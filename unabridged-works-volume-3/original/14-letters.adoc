== Letters of Isaac Penington

TO FRIENDS

He that is weak and foolish among the lambs, continually ready to wander,
both out of the pastures and from the fold,
and thus to betray his life into the hands of the enemy;
he who is continually scattering and squandering
away what the Lord in mercy gathers for him,
and freely bestows upon him; who, through drowsiness and carelessness,
hath lost the benefit of,
and forfeited the sweet and tender visitations of the Most High, and is now become dry,
dead, barren, thick, earthy;
O my God! let that soul feel the stirrings of the spring of life,
and find some encouragements from thee,
to hope in the free and large mercies of the Shepherd of Israel;
who casteth not off his sheep because of their wanderings, because of their backslidings,
because of their infirmities, because of their diseases, nay,
not because of their hardness; but pursues them with his love, findeth them out,
visiteth with his correcting hand according to their need, woundeth with his sword,
and melteth in his fire, until he hath made them tender and pliable,
and then he pours in the fresh oil of his salvation and sweetly healeth them.

O my friends and brethren in the pure life! be faithful
to the Lord in returning him all the incomes of his Spirit;
follow on in every drawing of his love,
while any of the virtue of it lasts upon your spirits.
Walk with him all the day long, and wait for him all the night season.
And in case of erring from him, or sinning grievously against him, be not discouraged;
for he is a God of mercies,
and delighteth in pardoning and forgiving much and very often.
What tender mother can be more ready to forgive and embrace the child,
that appears broken and afflicted with her sore displeasure!
Yea, He gives brokenness, he melteth the heart, that he may be tender towards,
and embrace it in his arms of reconciliation, and in the peace of his Spirit.

O my dear companions,
and fellow travellers in spirit towards the land of the living!
all the motions of the life are cross to the corrupt +++[+++part],
dwell +++[+++in the life], draw the yoke close about your necks,
that ye may come into unity with the life, and the corrupt be worn out.
Take the yoke, the cross, the contrariety of Jesus upon your spirits daily;
that that may be worn out which hinders the unity, and so,
ye may feel your King and Saviour exalted upon his throne in your hearts:
this is your rest, peace, life, kingdom, and crown forever.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

$$...$$This then is the way of redemption;
to wait to feel the appearance of the light of the Spirit in the heart; and,
at its least or lowest appearance, to be turned from the darkness towards it.
Oh! feel the redeeming arm in thine own heart,
and know the love which stretcheth it forth,
and take heed of being prejudiced against its inward visitations to thee:
for there is that near thee which would darken thee,
and keep the seed of life in bondage.
I know there is that in thee, which pants and is not satisfied,
somewhat that thirsts after the living waters.
The Spirit of the Lord saith, Come, come to the fountain of eternal life; drink, and live.

O Lord my God! discover to the thirsty souls,
what it is that withholds them from the living waters;
that they may not labor and spend their strength in vain,
in duties and ordinances invented by man, for that which may lull asleep for the present,
but can never quiet the cry of the living seed, nor ever satisfy the soul.

I know thy snare: there is a building in the earthly wisdom,
a knowledge which thou holdest in the comprehension,
out of the living feeling of that light, from which the true knowledge springs,
and in which alone it is held.
Thou must know the razing of this building,
the confounding and scattering of this knowledge;
that the true heir of the true knowledge may spring, and thou mayst feel the babe raised,
to whom God reveals the mysteries of his kingdom;
which he hides from the wise professors and teachers in this age,
as he hath done in all ages.
Thou art very wise; but thou must sell all that, and become a very fool,
if thou wilt have the riches and everlasting treasure of the kingdom.

And, if thou wouldst draw near and find access to God in prayer,
thou must wait to feel the birth pray,
and take heed of putting up requests in thy own wisdom, and according to thy own will;
for these are the prayers of the false-formed child, or counterfeited birth,
and not of the right seed; and the Father knows not, nor regards this voice.
This is our religion: to feel that, which God begets in our hearts,
preserved alive by God; to be taught by him to know him, to worship, and live to him,
in the leadings and by the power of his Spirit: and, in this religion,
we have the comforts and appearances of his Spirit;
which are past all the disputings and questionings of man`'s wisdom, yea,
and of our own hearts also,
being demonstrated and made manifest to our spirits in a higher principle.

I found my heart in great love drawn to write these things to thee;
and my soul pursueth them with breathings to the Lord my God, that hereby,
or by what other means he shall see good,
thou mayst be drawn into true unity and fellowship with the spring of eternal life;
and not be deceived from the precious enjoyment of the God of thy life here,
or of the salvation of thy soul forever: The path of life is living;
and thy feet must be guided into it, and walk faithfully in it to the end,
if thou wilt sit down in God`'s eternal rest and peace.

I have been long desolate, and a great mourner after my God,
and know how to pity and weep over wandering souls;
though I cannot but rejoice at this great day of
salvation and powerful visitation of God`'s Spirit,
wherein he hath sought out and gathered many into the fold of his pure rest,
where he is become their living Shepherd, and daily ministers of his life unto them.
And he is seeking out many more: happy are they,
that know and return at the Shepherd`'s voice, when he calleth after them.

I remain thy true, entire, faithful, loving Friend,
in the love and good-will of the Lord, wishing to thy soul as to my own.

I+++.+++ P.

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++

There is a question ariseth in my heart to thee, which is this:

How is the everlasting gospel (wherein Christ is truly made known,
and salvation really witnessed in the hearts of those
that receive it) preached at this day?
How hath the Lord appointed it to be preached, and how is it preached,
and how may men come to hear it, that their souls may live?
Are not they blessed that hear the joyful sound thereof?
Are not they wretched, and miserable, and blind, and naked,
who mistake and miss concerning the sound of it,
which it pleaseth the Spirit of the Lord to give forth in this our day?
O friend!
I beseech thee, consider it, and do not think it strange that I propose it to thee;
for he that would find the gospel, must search where it is hid;
and it is hid in them that are lost, who go astray from the life and power of it.

It is a wonderful thing, to those whom the Lord hath made truly sensible,
to consider how the Truth, the gospel, the life, the power which saves,
is one and the same in all ages and generations, and yet, still hid from the wise,
prudent, professing eye in every age and generation.
O friend! that thou didst thoroughly know that wise and prudent eye in thyself,
from which the Lord hides it, and that eye, which perhaps thou wilt not call prudent,
to which the Lord opens it.

Now friend, let me speak a few words to thee, not only from what I have felt in my heart,
but have also read in the Scriptures of truth.

The gospel, after the apostasy, is thus to be preached.
"`Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come;
and worship him that made heaven, and earth,`" etc. Rev. 14:7.
If thou knowest the Preacher that preached this,
if thou hast heard this preached in thine own heart,
if thou hast met with that fear there, which God`'s Spirit teacheth and giveth,
if thou hast known the hour of God`'s judgment,
and had the axe laid to the root of the tree;
and if thou hast been taught by the Son to worship the Father in Spirit and truth;
thou hast, without doubt, met with the gospel, the everlasting gospel;
and if God require of thee,
and assist thee by his Spirit and power to preach this to others,
thou art a preacher of the everlasting gospel, and an able minister of the New Testament,
not of the letter, but of the Spirit.
But I beseech thee,
take heed of preaching thine own formings and conceivings upon the letter,
as too many do in this day; for that falls short of true preaching the letter.
Oh let these things be weighty with thee! that thou mayst
learn aright to search and understand the Scriptures,
and know how the Father hath revealed the Son in this day, and how to come to him,
to receive life from him.
For many, through ignorance, mistake in this matter; and so run on in their own wills,
wisdom, and comprehension of things, and miss of the drawings of the Father; and thus,
come not aright to the Son, but only according as they imagine and apprehend,
according to what they have gathered and conceived upon the Scriptures.

Friend, God who caused light to shine in this outward world,
hath judged it necessary to cause the light of his Spirit to shine inwardly in the heart;
and this gives the knowledge of the Scriptures,
and the true sense and discerning of inward and spiritual things.
Yea, here the Son is known, and his blood felt cleansing; which, without this,
the Scriptures do not make manifest; but in this,
the Scriptures are a clear and faithful record of and testimony to them.
Oh take heed how thou readest, and how thou understandest the Scriptures,--in what light,
in what spirit! for it is easy erring;
and without the presence and guidance of God`'s Spirit herein,
thou canst not walk safely.
And truly it is great presumption in any man to read the Scriptures boldly,
and without fear and reverence to Him who penned them,
or to put any of his own meanings and conceivings upon God`'s words;
which it is hard for him to forbear to do,
who reads them in the liberty of his own spirit, out of the light of God`'s Spirit,
which is the limit and yoke of the true readers,
and of those who understand the Scriptures.

4th of Fourth Month,--

TO A COUPLE ABOUT TO MARRY.

DEAR FRIENDS,

It is a great and weighty thing that ye are about;
and ye have need of the Lord`'s leading and counsel therein,
that it may be done in the unity of his life;
that so Friends in Truth may feel it to be of God, and find satisfaction therein.

Friends, the affectionate part will be forward in things of this nature,
unless it be yoked down;
and it will persuade the mind to judge such things to be right and of the Lord,
when indeed they are not so.
Now, if it be not of the Lord, but the affectionate part,
Friends cannot have unity with it, nor will it prove a blessing to you;
but you will find it an hurt to your conditions, and a load upon your spirits afterwards,
and the fruits and effects of it will not be good, but evil; and then, perhaps,
ye will wish that ye had waited more singly and earnestly upon the Lord,
in relation to the thing; and that ye had taken more time,
and consulted more with Friends, before there had been any engagement of affections.
The Lord, by his providence, hath given you a little time of respite.
Oh, retire unto him, and abase yourselves before him, and pray him to counsel you,
by his good Spirit, for your good! that, if it be not of the Lord, the power,
being waited upon by you, may loosen your affections in this respect.
But if it be of the Lord, and be orderly brought before Friends,
and their counsel and advice sought in the fear of the Lord,
they will have unity with it, and with gladness express their unity;
which may be a strength unto you, against the tempter afterwards.

This is in true love to you, and in singleness of heart, the Lord knoweth.
From your friend in the truth.

I+++.+++ P.

TO MILES STANCLIF.

DEAR M. S.,

Thou art often in my heart; and indeed, I do many times bow unto the Father of spirits,
for the preservation of whatever is good in thee,
for the clear discovery to thee of what is not of his pure life,
and for the separation of thy mind from it; that the life of Christ may conquer in thee,
and thou thereby be fully redeemed to the Lord.
I often inquire after thee;
and when I hear of any tenderness or diligence in thee towards the truth,
my heart rejoiceth therein.

Dear friend, deceit is very deep, and hath much prevailed;
but the Lord is gathering out of it, and preparing such, by the power of his life,
against future snares.
O dear friend! take heed of thy own wisdom, thy own sense, thy own judgment,
which thou mayest easily, through mistake, call the Lord`'s;
but to have all that is of self searched out and brought under,
and the mind made truly sensible of, and fully subject to,
the life in everything,--this is a sore travel; and it is very hard to come hither,
through all deceits and entanglements.
The Lord entirely join thy mind to that and preserve thee in that,
which gives thee at any time a sense of truth, and of those who are in the truth:
these are to be known and honored in the Lord, according to their growth.
And take heed of that which prejudices and disjoins;
but feel and cleave to that which uniteth in love, life, and pure power.
Know that unity and fellowship which is in the spirit; and keep it,
keep it in the bond of pure peace: and take heed,
oh forever take heed of whatever would break the bond!
but that which makes of one mind and one judgment,
one heart and one soul, that is the living principle, that is the living power,
which all the members of the body are to inhabit and be one in.
And watch against the reasonings of the mind, and the thoughts of thy heart;
watch to the sense which riseth up in the fear, in the love, in the humility,
that thou mayest feel the leadings of God`'s Spirit,
and come through all that stands in thy way;
having the help of all whom the Lord hath ordained, and made able to be helpers to thee.
For life is not to be limited, but we are to be limited by that which is of the life;
and in cases of doubt, it is the ordinance of the Lord,
for the weak to receive counsel and help from the strong,
and for the lesser to be watched over and blessed by the
greater,--by such as are more grown up in the life,
and in the power.

So the Lord God Almighty lead thee fully into, and preserve thee perfectly in,
the way everlasting.

Thy friend in the true love,

I+++.+++ P.

16th of Third month, 1668.

TO JOHN MANNOCK.

FRIEND,

Hath the Lord drawn thy heart to hear the sound of truth,
and given thee some sense and savor thereof,
though perhaps not as yet full satisfaction in all things
that are truly and faithfully testified concerning it?
Oh prize this love of God to thee! and watch and pray, and come into the pure fear;
that thou mayst walk worthy of it,
and mayst discern in spirit what it is that gives thee the savor;
and so receive the leaven of the kingdom,
and feel its leavening virtue upon thy heart day by day.
For after the Lord hath been at work, the enemy will be at work also;
and thou mayst both meet with him without, and within too,
in reasonings and questionings against the demonstrations
of God`'s Spirit to thy heart and conscience.
Now if thou wilt hearken to these,
they will eat out the sense and belief of what God`'s Spirit begat in thee.
Oh! how many wise men, and how many knowing men,
that have tasted of some true experiences,
have not the sense and discerning of the Spirit and power of the Lord,
as it is now made manifest; but speak hard words,
and think hard thoughts of his truth and its precious appearances.

Ah! what are we, any of us, on whom the Lord hath shown his mercy,
and whose hearts he toucheth, and maketh sensible of his drawings?
yea, and not only so, but also gives us to partake of the eternal life and virtue,
which he hath hid in his Son from the eyes of all living.
We sought it up and down, in the deeps and heights; but the deep said, It is not in me;
and the highest mountain and hill that ever we met with, could not bring salvation to us.
But at length we found the fear of the Lord to be the true wisdom,
and that which taught us to depart from evil, gave us the true understanding.
Now if any among us are not thus taught,
but only own the doctrines of truth published among us,
being thereunto overcome by the demonstration of God`'s Spirit;
yet for all this they are not felt by us in the life
and unity of the Spirit of the Lord with us;
and such the Lord will manifestly prune off in his own due time,
and graft in others in their stead.
Yea, such as do indeed give up to truth, and in measure feel the power of it,
and are made by the power of the Lord subject to it--yet,
if in any thing they let in the spirit of the world, and act according thereto,
so far they are not of the truth, nor owned by it.

Now dear friend (for so far as thy heart is touched by God`'s Spirit and answereth thereto,
thou art dear unto me), mind thy condition, and wait on the Lord in humility of heart,
and in subjection to what he inwardly by his Spirit daily makes manifest;
that thou mayest come into the obedience of the truth daily;
that thou mayest daily feel the change which is wrought
in the heart and conscience by the holy,
eternal, ever-living power; that so thou mayest witness according to the Scriptures,
"`that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.`" And then thou wilt feel
that this birth of the Spirit cannot fulfill the lusts of the flesh,
but will be warring and fighting the good fight of faith,
in the power of life against them;
and thus in faithfulness to the truth and waiting upon the Lord,
thou shalt witness an overcoming in his due time.
For indeed the true faith overcomes, the true shield beats down the most fiery darts,
and in the power of the Lord the enemy is so resisted, that he fleeth;
and the name of the Lord is indeed a strong tower to his children,
to which his seed know how to retire and feel safety.

Oh the conquering faith, the overcoming life and power of the Spirit!
We cannot but speak of those things; and cry up the perfect gift, and the power of Him,
who is not only able to perfect his work in the heart, but delights so to do;
and even to tread down Satan under the feet of those
that wait in patience for the perfect conquest;
for nothing else will fully satisfy.
The rest, the peace, the liberty, the life, the virtue of the gospel,
is not fully known and enjoyed while there remains any sin to sting and trouble.
And this I can faithfully witness; that when the power is revealed,
when the blood washeth, the soul is clean and as white as snow;
and the enemy hath not power to break in, but life triumphs over him.
And why may there not be a continuance of such a state?
Yea, I verily believe many can witness a continuance of such a state;
which the Spirit of the Lord doth not call less in them than a perfect state,
a sound state; wherein Christ, the heavenly Physician, hath healed them perfectly,
and made them witnesses of true soundness of soul and spirit in the sight of God.
Oh that all knew and enjoyed it who truly desire and long after it!

But as for thee, this is in my heart to thee.
Thou hast found the pearl; the Lord, in mercy to thee,
hath discovered to thee the true pearl.
Now this remains; that thou be a wise merchant, selling all to purchase it.
Thou must keep back nothing.
Christ, the living truth, the holy power of righteousness,
must be dearer to thee than all.
If father, mother, livelihood, liberty, friendship, outward advantages, etc.,
or any thing else be dearer to thee than him, he will look upon thee as unworthy of him;
and cannot but turn from thee, and suffer hardness and darkness to come again upon thee.
Therefore prize the day of thy visitation from the holy God,
from the God of mercy and salvation; and be faithful in the little,
in the day of small things, if ever thou desire to enjoy and be ruler over much.
The Lord may exercise thee in, and require of thee, little things;
as he hath done the rest of the flock,
whose footsteps thou art to follow to the Shepherd`'s tents;
and the enemy will be endeavoring to stop thee, and perplex thee,
in every little thing that the Lord requires of thee.
But be thou simple, like a child, not taking care what to answer wise professors,
nor what to answer the reasonings of thy own mind;
but seeing thou hast felt the demonstration of truth from God`'s Holy Spirit,
oh! breathe unto the Lord to preserve thee in the innocency and simplicity thereof,
that the Lord may still be with thee;
and thereby bring thee through the day of Jacob`'s trouble,
to taste of Jacob`'s deliverance and salvation out of trouble:
for thou must meet with trials as well as others have done,
and the enemy`'s endeavor will be,
to make thee stumble and start back in the day of trial.
But if thine eye be towards the Lord, he will uphold and strengthen thee,
and bring thee through all that stands in thy way;
manifesting to thee daily more and more the path of holiness,
in which the ransomed of the Lord walk, and enabling thee also to walk therein.

Therefore watch the thoughts and reasonings which rise in thee, and retire from them,
waiting to feel the pure seed, and to hear its voice in stillness;
whose voice is otherwise, than after the noises of the questionings and reasonings,
which the enemy raiseth in the mind, to fill it with doubts and troubles;
and to weaken the faith and sense which God wrought in the heart,
when he reached forth his truth in the power and demonstration of his Spirit unto it.
This was God`'s love, this was the day of his power;
which loosens the mind from its lovers, and the ways of its own choosing,
and begets a willingness to be joined to the Lord and his pure truth.

Oh, take heed of hearkening to the enemy, to the subtle reasoner,
the entangler of the soul! take heed of consulting there,
where he lays his baits to entangle the mind,
and undo the work of God`'s power in the heart; and so to make unwilling again,
after the Lord had made willing.
The steps which the soul takes in the power,
even the inclining of the mind towards the Lord and his pure truth, tend to salvation;
but if any let in unbelief of those things,
concerning which God hath wrought faith in them, they draw back to perdition;
they hearken to that which tempts from the Lord, and to him whose end is to destroy them.

This is in true love to thee, and from an upright desire,
that thou mayest feel the Lord`'s preservation of thy soul, in that which is of him,
and his separating thee from all that is not of him.

From a friend to all that breathe after the Lord,
and desire to know and partake of the power and life of truth, as it is in Jesus,
the alone Redeemer and Saviour of the soul.

I+++.+++ P.

TO JOHN MANNOCK.

FRIEND,

It is a wonderful thing, to witness the power of God reaching to the heart,
and demonstrating to the soul the pure way to life, as in his sight and presence.
Surely he that partakes of this is therein favored by the Lord,
and ought diligently to wait,
for the giving up to the leadings of his Holy Spirit in everything; that so,
he may travel through all that is contrary to the Lord,
into that nature and spirit which is of him.
It is a wonderful thing also to witness God`'s preservation from backsliding,
and from being entangled by the subtlety of the enemy;
who hath many ways and taking devices to ensnare the simple mind,
and draw it from the sense of truth, into some notions and belief of things;
wherein the soul may be lulled asleep with hopes and persuasions,
but hath not the feeling or enjoyment of the true life and power.

O friend! hast thou a sense of the way to the Father?
then, be careful that thy spirit daily bow before him,
and wait for breathings to him from his pure Spirit,
that he would continue his mercy to thee; keeping thee in the true sense,
and making thy way more and more clear before thee every day; yea,
and bearing thee up in all the exercises and trials which may befall thee, in every kind;
that, by his secret working in thy spirit,
and helping thee with a little help from time to time,
thou mayest still be advancing nearer and nearer towards the kingdom;
until thou find the Lord God administer an entrance unto thee thereinto,
and give thee an inheritance of life, joy, righteousness, and peace therein;
which is strength unto the soul against sin and death,
and against the sorrow and trouble which ariseth in the mind,
for want of God`'s presence and holy power revealed there.

And be not careful after the flesh, but trust the Lord.
What though thou art weak, and little;
though thou meet with those that are wise and knowing;
and almost every way able to reason thee down;
what though thou hast not wherewith to answer;
yet thou knowest and hast the feeling of God`'s pure Truth in spirit,
with a desire to have the life of it brought forth in thee,
and so to witness the change and renewings which are by his power.
O dear heart! herein thou art accepted of the Lord,
and here his tender love and care will be over thee,
and his mercy will daily reach to thee;
and thou shalt have true satisfaction in thy heart, and hold the Truth there,
where all the reasonings of men, and all the devices of the enemy of thy soul,
shall not be able to reach; yea,
thou shalt so feel the Lord to help his babe against the strength of the mighty,
in the seasons of his good pleasure, as shall exceedingly turn to his praise;
and so thou shalt experience that whom God preserves,
all the gates of hell shall not be able to prevail against.
Therefore look not out at men, or at the words and wisdom of men;
but keep where thou hast felt the Lord visit thee,
that he may visit thee yet again and again every day,
and be teaching thee further and further the way to his dwelling-place,
and be drawing thee thither, where is righteousness, life, rest, and peace forever.

This arose in my heart this morning in tender love towards thee.
Look up to the Lord, who can make it useful to thee, to warm, quicken,
and strengthen thy heart and mind towards the Lord, and his pure truth,
wherewith he has visited thee.
And if thou feel any thing therein suitable to the state and condition of thy soul, oh,
bow before the Lord! that in the true humility thou mayest confess,
and give the glory to him of what belongs to him.

From thy friend in the truth, which cleanseth the heart from iniquity,
as it is embraced and dwelt in.

I+++.+++ P.

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++

O FRIEND!

That thou hadst the true sense of the drift of my heart in writing
and sending things to thee!--which is and hath been this--that
thou mightest be acquainted with that of God in the heart,
which quickens to him; and in the light of that, mightest try thy heart and ways,
and so only justify in thyself what God justifies, and let all else go.

Shall the Lord appear mightily on the earth and Israel not know him?
Shall the professors of this age understand no more his appearance in Spirit,
than the Jews did his appearance in flesh?
Shall they stumble at the very same stumbling stone?
Yes, the same stumbling stone is laid, for that wisdom to stumble at,
as in all generations; and there is no avoiding stumbling,
but by coming out of that wisdom into babe-like simplicity,
which gives entrance into pure, heavenly wisdom.
And this I dare affirm as in God`'s presence and in his pure fear,
having received the sense thereof from him--that there is
none that opposeth this his present appearance (by the greatest
knowledge and wisdom of their comprehensions from the letter),
but would also have opposed and denied his appearance in that body of flesh,
had they lived in that day.
For the wisdom which they gathered from the letter, did not reveal Christ in that day,
but the Father; and the same reveals him in this day.

Oh that thou couldst feel the pure revelation from the Father to thy heart!
Oh wait for a new heart, a new ear, a new eye! even to feel the pure in thee,
and thy mind changed by the pure, that all things may become new to thee;
the Scriptures new (they are so indeed when God opens them), duties new, ordinances new,
graces new, experiences new; a new church of the Spirit`'s building,
wherein he and thy soul may dwell together;
and thou mayest be able to say in the presence of the Lord,
this is a city of God`'s own building, the foundation whereof was laid with sapphires,
whose walls are salvation, and its gates praise.

12th of Third Month, 1669.

TO CATHERINE PORDAGE.

FRIEND,

Thy estate and condition hath been pretty much with me since I last saw thee.
I am sensible how hard it is for thee to give up
to be reached by the seed and power of life;
how readily and easily thy ear and heart is opened to another,
and the adulterer entertained, who hunteth after the precious life.
This word of advice hath been much in my heart to thee this morning:
Sit down and count the cost of plowing up thy field,
and of searching after the hidden treasure of pure and true wisdom,
and consider seriously, whether thou canst sell all for it,
both inward and outward riches; that if thou do set thy hand to the plow,
thou mayest not look back after any thing else, within or without,
but mayest be content and satisfied with the pearl of true wisdom and life alone.

Now if thou be truly willing in God`'s sight thus to do,
thou must singly give up to follow the Lord in the leadings of his Spirit,
out of all the ways of thy own wisdom and knowledge,
out of all things wherein thou hast a life and delight out of him;
thou must not determine what thou hast a life in, but the Lord must search thy heart,
and he will soon show thee (if thy heart be naked and open before him,
willing to hear and learn of him) somewhat in thy heart, somewhat in thy ways,
somewhat in thy words, thoughts, etc., which is contrary to his pure life and Spirit;
and then that must be denied and given up immediately.
And afterwards perhaps the Lord will soon discover to thee another lover,
which hath had more of thy heart than thou hast been aware of;
and so thou must part with one after another until thou hast parted with all;
and this will prepare thee for the bosom of thy Beloved, who is a jealous God,
and seeth not with the eye wherewith man seeth.
But if thou be not thus singly given up, though thou should put thy hand to the plow,
thou wilt be looking back some time or other:
and that wisdom which draweth aside from the Lord will blind thy eye,
and deceive thy mind, and draw thee from the simplicity and nakedness of truth,
into some image or other of it, so that instead of the pure truth itself,
thou wilt believe and embrace a lie.

Thou hast travelled long in the heights above the seed; oh,
consider if that be not yet standing in thee, which could not have been found standing,
if thou hadst known the true seed and travelled therewith!
This enhances the price of truth as to thee, that thou must part with more for it,
than will be required of many others; yet if thou be faithful to the Lord,
and diligently follow him in the simplicity,
truth will at length recompense thee for all thy labors, sorrows, and travels.
But a thorough work will the Lord make in thy earth, if thou singly give up unto him,
and faithfully follow;
and many devices will thou meet with to turn thy mind out of the way,
and to cause thee to shun the bitterness of the cross,
and to kindle and nourish a hope in thee,
that thou mayest find a more easy way to the same life and everlasting substance.
The Lord hath reached to thee, and the Lord is willing to search thy heart,
to find out the deceiver and enemy in his most secret lurking-places;
but when the Lord hath found him out, thou must give him up to God`'s stroke,
and not suffer him to find a shelter in thy mind to save him therefrom.
For he is very subtle,
and will twist and twine all manner of ways to deceive thee and save himself;
nor art thou yet acquainted with, or able to discern his devices.
The Lord alone can help thee, and he will help thee,
if thou be not hasty to join with the enemy,
nor give up thy judgment to believe what he represents,
and seems inwardly to represent to thee as true;
but abide and dwell in the sense of thy own inability to judge,
waiting to feel that which is true, pure, and living of God, judge in thee,
not so much in demonstrations of wisdom,
as in tender and secret drawings of the beginnings of a new nature,
away from what is of an earthly nature.
For thou must come out of the spirit of this world, if thou wilt come into God`'s Spirit;
and thou must come out of the love of the things of this world,
if thou wilt come out of the spirit of this world;
for in the love of the things of this world,
the spirit of this world lodgeth and dwelleth,
and thou canst not touch the unclean thing,
but thou also touchest somewhat of the unclean spirit.
Therefore said John from a true and deep understanding, "`Love not the world,
neither the things of the world,`" (if thou love the things of the world,
thou lovest the world), for "`if any man love the world,
the love of the Father is not in him.`"

The day of God`'s mercy and visitation is upon thee,
who is visiting that spirit in thee which hath led thee aside,
even with the judgment proper for it; that Zion in thee might be thereby redeemed,
and thy soul converted to, and truly brought forth in, righteousness.

TO THOMAS WALMSLEY.

DEAR FRIEND,

There is somewhat on my heart this morning to write to thee,
in the same love wherein I have hitherto written, which I feel to be pure, of God,
and unfeigned towards thee and all men;
though it also putteth a difference between those
that are renewed by him and bear his image,
and those who have only a form of religion, without the power and life thereof,
which sanctifies and redeems up to God, wherever it is received.

That which was on my heart to thee, in true, pure, and tender love, is this which follows:

All true religion hath a true root; and that religion, profession, worship, faith, hope,
peace, assurance, etc., which groweth not from the true root, is not true.

Now this root is near, and must be felt near,
bearing the branch and causing it to bring forth fruit.
It is not enough to hear of Christ, or read of Christ;
but this is the thing,--to feel him my root, my life, my foundation;
and my soul ingrafted into him, by him who hath power to ingraft.
To feel repentance given me by him, faith given me by him,
the Father revealed and made known to me by him,
by the pure shinings of his light in my heart; God,
who caused the light to shine out of darkness, causing it to shine there;
so that in and through him, I come to know, not the Son himself only,
but the Father also:--and then to come out of the darkness, out of the sin,
out of the pollutions of the spirit of this world, into the pure,
holy fellowship of the living, by his holy guidance and conduct;
and so to feel all my prayers, all my comforts, all my willingness,
all my ability to do and suffer for God and the testimony of his truth,
to arise from this holy, pure root of life,
which gives daily strength against sin and death, to all who wait,
in true humility and pure subjection of soul and spirit upon him:--here
is unspeakable comfort and satisfaction given by him to the soul,
which all the reasonings of men, with all the devices of Satan, cannot damp.
For He who gave it preserves and maintains it over all the strength that can assault it.

O friend!
I beseech thee mind this; come, oh come to the true root! come to Christ indeed!
Rest not in an outward knowledge; but come to the inward life, the hidden life,
and receive life from him who is the life;
and then abide in and live to God in the life of his Son.
For death and destruction, corruption and vanity, may talk of the fame of Christ,
who is the wisdom of God;
but they cannot know nor find out the place where this wisdom is revealed;
they cannot come at the true, pure fear, which God puts into the hearts of his;
this is the beginning of the true wisdom which cleanses darkness
and impurity out of the hearts of those to whom it is given.
For light expelleth darkness; life expelleth death; purity expelleth impurity; Christ,
where he is received, bindeth and casts out the strong man,
taking possession of the heart.
And if any man be truly and really in Christ, he comes to witness a new creation,
even the passing away of old things, and all things becoming new.

Christ is faithful in all his house ("`whose house are we,`" saith the apostle,
"`if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope,
firm unto the end.`" Heb. 3:6), faithful as a Son,
who comes in the name and authority of the Father,
to do whatsoever is to be done in the heart,
faithful in discovering whatever is contrary to God there,
faithful in engaging his power against it.
And shall not his power prevail?
and where it doth prevail, and the good pleasure of God`'s goodness is fulfilled,
and the work of faith with power,
is not the name of the Lord Jesus Christ glorified there?
Read 2 Thess. 1:11-12. and consider.
Did Christ overcome the devil in that body of his flesh,
and shall he not overcome him in the hearts of his children by the power of his Spirit,
which he received of the Father to comfort them,
and carry on his work gloriously in them?
What shall become of those that do not fight under Christ, and overcome through Christ?
Read Rev. 3:21. I would not have thee deceived of thy soul,
or of that religion which saves the soul, which religion stands not in word,
but in power.
Therefore wait to feel the Spirit and power of Christ saving
thee from that which nothing else can save thee from;
and bringing that down in thee under his feet which nothing else can bring down.

This is from the true desire which my soul hath,
after the eternal salvation and satisfaction of thine.

TO ELIZABETH WaLMSLEY.

DEAR FRIEND,

Who art lovely to me in that precious life wherewith the Lord hath visited thee,
and wherein he hath brought thee forth for his service, and to his praise.

Our Father is wise and powerful, who hath begun a work which he is able to carry on;
and all the briars and thorns of the wilderness are not able to stop his course,
who is "`a consuming fire.`"

I find the spirits of Friends here much raised,
who dwell in the fear and dread of the Lord God Almighty,
where the fear and dread of man is removed far away.
The Lord preserve us near unto himself, out of that which separates from him and weakens;
and nothing shall be able to interrupt our joy in the Lord,
nor our delight and pleasure in his will.
Lo!
I come, saith the child, to do thy will, O God! to drink the cup thou hast prepared;
although there is a nature which cannot but say, If it be possible, let it pass away;
but that nature is bowed down and subjected under its proper yoke, and, in submission,
is kept out of sinning against the Lord, and is accepted by him who bows it,
and makes it willing to follow the Lamb in the day of his power.

Truly the Lord hath done great things for us!
He hath given us the sight and knowledge of himself in his Son, which is life eternal:
he hath given us of the nature and spirit of his Son;
he hath given us of the true faith whereby the just lives, and obtains victory over sin,
death, and the grave; he hath given us of the hope which purifies the heart,
and stays the mind in all storms;
he hath given us of the Lamb`'s patience and meekness etc.
And now if he will brighten these by afflictions, and try them,
and cause them to shine to his glory; yea, and take advantage to increase them,
and add further virtue to them, what cause have any of us to complain?
Israel of old, after the flesh, murmured upon every trial; but Israel,
after the new creation, doeth not so, but blesseth the Lord,
and repineth not at the instruments which he permitteth to afflict them;
but they love the Lord and love his truth, and are faithful in their testimony thereto,
whatever befalls them.
Yea, they rejoice that they are counted worthy to suffer in any kind for his name`'s sake,
and are like lambs before the shearers,
not opening their mouths in a way of murmuring or reviling; but instead thereof,
pitying them, praying for them, and blessing;
because God hath made them children of love, children of peace, children of blessing;
which nature they retain, in the midst of all their trials and afflictions,
and show forth the virtues of Him that hath called them.

So that men shall not put out our life, nor put out our light,
nor sever us from the love and power of God; but the more need we find of our God,
and of his help and strength, the nearer shall we be driven to him,
and dwell more closely in union with him, and in holy and humble dependence upon him.
And in this temper shall we draw and receive more from him:
and the more we draw from him, the better will it be with us,
and the more like him shall we be.

The Lord keep open that heavenly eye in his children and servants,
which looks over this world, with the affairs and concerns thereof,
to that which is immortal and invisible; where our life is hid from others,
though made manifest in and felt by us, from the living spring which quickens,
nourisheth, and refresheth.
And as afflictions abound from men, so shall consolations, life,
and strength abound from the Lord, unto all, and upon all, who look not out,
but abide and await there, where it springs and flows.

My dear love is to Friends in these parts (particularly M.O.);
the Lord preserve them and keep them near to himself,
that they may receive counsel and strength from him, according to their need.
I am sensible of thy great love to us, expressed in thy care and tenderness of our child,
as well as in other things: I hope she is no burden to thee.
Oh that she might feel and be guided by that which
keeps in order all that are subject to it!

I remain thy friend and brother, in the life and love which never dies nor changes,

TO WIDOW HEMMINGS.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

Whom I truly love, and whose prosperity in the truth I earnestly desire.
Because I find thy mind much engaged about one thing; to wit,
receiving bread and wine in remembrance of Christ`'s death, which I am tender to thee in;
yet withal, it is on my heart at this time to say somewhat to thee;
perhaps the Lord may open thy mind, and let thee into some sense of the thing.

There is a supper, or supping with Christ, beyond outward bread and wine,
which he promised to those that heard his voice, opened the door, and let him in. Rev. 3:20.
Now it is that supper,
it is the desire of my heart thou mayst be acquainted with, and partake of.
And as thou comest to be acquainted with it, and partake of it,
thou wilt call it the feast of fat things, and of wines on the lees well refined.
Christ said, "`Henceforth I will drink no more of this fruit of the vine,
till I drink it new with you in my Father`'s kingdom.`" What wine,
what fruit of the vine is it which Christ drinks
new with his disciples in his Father`'s kingdom?
Is it not that wine, which he and they drink now together when he sups with them?
Oh, the Lord give thee an understanding, that thou mayst come to the substance,
feel substance, and inherit substance forever!

"`Flee from idolatry, my dearly beloved,`" said the apostle. 1 Cor. 10:14.
What idolatry did he mean?
"`I speak as to wise men,`" said he "`judge ye what I say.
The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?
The bread which we break,
is it not the communion of the body of Christ?`" About the outward cup and bread,
might they not easily run into idolatry?
but they that knew, discerned, and minded the body and blood indeed,
they did not run into idolatry.
"`For we being many, are one bread and one body;
for we are all partakers of that one bread.`" Oh, deep, deep, indeed!
The bread which comes down from heaven, that is the bread which gives life to the soul:
and unless we eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, we have no life in us.
And if we eat his flesh and drink his blood, we become one flesh with him,
and bone of his bone; yea, we become of the same bread with him,
and so of the one body of the living bread.

My dear friend, the Lord give thee an understanding, and open thy heart,
and cause thee to grow into union and into sense of his truth;
that by growing up in the truth, thou mayst come more and more to understand it,
and be acquainted with it.

Thy unfeigned friend in the truth which is pure,

I+++.+++ P.

Reading Jail, 3rd of Sixth Month, 1670

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++

THE Lord God of heaven and earth, who searcheth the heart and trieth the reins, knows,
that we who are called Quakers have no secret things
or hidden principles among us to win people to;
but as we have ourselves been won to the simplicity and plainness of truth,
as it is in Christ Jesus, and walk therein,
so it is the single desire of our hearts to bring men thither,
where they may have the demonstration of God`'s Spirit,
and hear the true witness speaking truth in their own consciences.
And indeed it was great matter of satisfaction to our hearts,
when the Lord turned us to his truth, that we found it to be no new thing,
but that which we had witnessed and experienced in the days of our former profession.
For we well remembered that we had been acquainted with it then;
and God now gives us the true and certain sense, that all the prayers, and knowledge,
and understanding of the Scriptures, faith, love, zeal, meekness, patience, humility,
and whatever we then had, which was dear unto us, and precious in the eye of God,
came from this Spirit of life, this principle of life,
which God hath now manifested to us, and turned our minds unto.
And oh that they, who yet speak against it, knew it,
as the Lord hath given us to know! surely they could not
then either think or speak so hardly of it as they do.
But Christ was the Son of God in his appearance in flesh,
whatever the wise men and professors of that age judged and spake of him.
And this is the appearance and manifestation of the same Christ inwardly,
even the same virtue, life, and power, which appeared in that body of flesh,
whatever the professors of this age think or speak concerning it;
and they are not guiltless before the Lord, but deeply guilty for rising up against it.

There was a precious appearance of God among that sort that were called Puritans,
before there was such a rent among them by falling into several ways of worship.
There was among them great sincerity, and love, and tenderness,
and unity in that which was true; minding the work of God in themselves,
and being sensible of grace and truth in one another`'s hearts.
Now to desire to know the true worship, this was good;
but every one that had this desire, was not acquainted with the Spirit of the Lord,
nor did wait aright on him, to be led by him into the true worship,
but followed the apprehensions and conceivings of their own minds upon the Scriptures.
Now had these known the true Leader, they would never thus have wandered,
nor have been so scattered from the Puritan state, which was better than any of these.
For is it possible, if the Spirit of God had been the Leader of these,
they could thus have wandered from the truth, life, love, and sense, into a barren,
dead state in comparison of that?
It is true there was a sincerity and simplicity in many of them;
but was not that sincerity and simplicity betrayed,
and drawn out to seek the living among the dead, among dead forms, ways, and worships?
For though they carried some life with them into their forms,
yet by degrees the form grew, and the virtue and power of godliness decreased,
and they were swallowed up in high esteem of, and contendings, each sort,
for their forms; but themselves had lost what they were inwardly to God,
and had inwardly received from God in the days of their former zeal and tenderness.
Oh that they could see this!
Oh that they could return to their Puritan state, to the sense they then had,
the love and tenderness that was then in them, to the feeling of the principle of life,
which they then felt,
and which then wrought in them! though they then distinctly knew it not,
yet they loved that which gathered their minds to God,
and in which they felt ability to pray,
and which opened the Scriptures and the things of God,
and warmed their hearts truly and livingly in some measure.
Oh that they were but there again! they might soon come further.
Oh that they knew their state, as it is known in the light of the Lord,
and by the Spirit of the Lord!
The Lord open the true eye in them, and give them to see therewith.

I+++.+++ P.

Reading Jail, 19th of Seventh Month, 1670

TO NATHANIEL STONAR.

DEAR FRIEND,

There was somewhat on my heart towards thee this morning,
which I am willing in truth and uprightness to express to thee, as the Lord knoweth.

There is a great dispute between us and professors, concerning the rule;
which they hold forth the Scriptures to be.
Now truly I could wish, from the depth of love in my heart to them,
and from my desire of their good, that the Scriptures, rightly understood by them,
were their rule; and not their own reasonings, conceivings,
and apprehendings upon the Scriptures.
But yet, if it were so, they must needs assent to me,
that the Spirit of life,--that the truth, which lives in the heart,--that the law,
written by the finger of God in the inward parts,--is nearer and more powerful,
than the words, or outward relations concerning those things in the Scriptures.
There is a measure of life to be received, there is the Spirit of life to be received,
there is a well of life, from which pure life springs up,
to be received and enjoyed by them that truly and rightly believe.

The Lord, in the gospel state, hath promised to be present with his people;
not as a wayfaring man for a night, but to dwell in them and walk in them.
Yea, if they be tempted and in danger of erring, they shall hear a voice behind them,
saying, "`This is the way, walk in it.`" Will they not grant this to be a rule,
as well as the Scriptures?
Nay, is not this a more full direction to the heart, in that state,
than it can pick to itself out of the Scriptures?
Truly, this ensuing testimony is true, which now springs up in my heart unto thee,
which is this;--the Lord hath poured out his Spirit upon his sons and daughters,
in and by this precious dispensation of truth, and of the pure seed,
which is so despised.
And the Spirit which gave forth the words is greater than the words;
therefore we cannot but prize Him himself,
and set Him higher in our hearts and thoughts than the words which testify of Him,
though they also are very sweet and precious to our taste.

There was a measure and rule,
whereunto the true minister of Christ and the believing Gentiles had attained,
by which they were to walk;
as is mentioned in 2 Cor. 10:13,15. "`According to the measure of the
rule which God hath distributed to us`"--"`according to our rule,`" etc.:
and in Philippians 3:16, "`Whereto we have already attained,
let us walk by the same rule,
let us mind the same thing;`" as also in Galatians 6:15-16, "`For in Christ Jesus,
neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy,`" etc.
Now consider what that rule was.
Oh that thou mayst know it and walk thereby, as they that had received God`'s Spirit did!
For I am assured in my heart, that if thou receive God`'s Spirit,
and live and walk therein, thou canst not fulfill the desires of the flesh;
but thou wilt find thy heart opened thereby into a true sense, understanding,
and right use of the Scriptures.
For the Scriptures of the New Testament were written to the saints,
and cannot be truly or rightly understood or made use of,
but as men come into their spirit and state.

These things are of great weight and concernment:
the Lord open and guide thy heart into true satisfaction in this and other things also,
from the demonstration of his own Spirit;
that thou mayst be able truly to say as in his sight,
Now I believe and understand things, not because this or that man hath so said,
but because the Lord, who is the Teacher indeed,
hath taught and assured my heart concerning the truth itself, as it is in Jesus;
which I feel to be so, by its living virtue and powerful operation in and upon my heart.

This is my desire for thee, who am thy soul`'s true and sincere friend,
who would by no means have thee deceived about any thing that concerns it.

I+++.+++ P.

Reading Jail, 24th of Seventh Month, 1670

TO WIDOW HEMMINGS

DEAR FRIEND,

Since I last saw thee there have been many deep and
serious thoughts on my heart concerning thee;
and a sense of thy state as before the Lord, and breathings of heart for thee.
I am sensible that the Spirit of the Lord is striving with thee,
and in some measure opening thy heart towards him and his truth;
and I am sensible withal, that there is much striving against him;
and many strong-holds of wisdom and reasonings in thee, which must be broken down,
before truth can spring up in thy heart, and exercise its power in thee,
and have full command in thee.

Now this morning when I awoke, there were three things sprang up in me,
which my heart did singly and earnestly desire for thee.
One was that thou mightst be led by God`'s Holy Spirit into the new and living covenant,
where Christ is revealed,
and the soul united to him as its Lord and King in a bond of indissoluble union.
Another was that thou mightst daily be taught of God, and learn of him in this holy, new,
pure, and everlasting covenant.
The third was, that thou mightest be true and faithful to God, to obey and follow him,
in whatever he teaches and requires of thee.

If thou wert but in this state thou wouldst find sweetness and rest, peace and power,
the righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ, and life eternal revealed in thy own heart;
and with joy draw water out of the wells of salvation.

Now if thou come to witness Christ`'s appearance in spirit,
and wilt become a disciple unto him,
there are three things thou must apply thy heart to learn of him;
which indeed are the sum of the gospel, or of what is taught in and by the gospel.
The first is, to fear God.
This is the beginning of true, heavenly wisdom,
and this is the perfection and the end of wisdom also;
for true wisdom not only brings into the fear, but it builds up in the fear, yea,
and perfects in the fear also; according as the apostle saith,
"`Perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord.`" Now this
is not such a fear as man can attain by all he can do;
but is the fear of the new covenant,
which God puts into the hearts of his children as
he quickens them and brings them up in the new covenant.
This is such a fear as that those in whom it is placed, cannot depart from the Lord;
nor abiding in it, err from the way of life and holiness; for all sin and transgression,
all rebellion against the Lord, and grieving and quenching his Spirit,
is out of this fear.
Oh that thou mightst receive this fear from the Lord, and grow up unto him daily in it!

The second, which depends upon and flows from the former, is, to give glory to God,
in discerning his life and power, and the virtue of his Spirit and his grace,
working all in thee; and so still ascribing the glory to him of all thou art, dost,
or canst do; for in the day of the gospel, no flesh can glory in the presence of our God;
but the Lord alone is exalted in the spirits of his children in that day.
And indeed, as every one comes into the fear of the new covenant,
the presence of the Lord is there, dwelling in the midst of the heart;
and he is found working all therein, and bringing forth the seed of life,
and working down sin, and death, and corruption.
And they that are here feel their own poverty and nothingness as in themselves;
and that their way to become strong in Christ, is first to become weak in themselves:
and so when they are strong in him, he who is their strength is glorified and admired,
and self is of no reputation or value forever and ever;
for that is cleaved to which brought down self, and that power and spirit,
being cleaved to, still keeps it down.

The third is, that thou learn to worship God in spirit and truth.
Oh this worship is precious indeed! and this is the
only sort of worship which God seeketh and regardeth,
among the many various kinds of worshippers which appear at this day.
This worship was declared by Christ, and taught his disciples;
but it has been in great measure departed from; and though many have sought after it,
yet none ever could find it,
but as they have learned of the Father to return to the anointing;
and so to be gathered into his Spirit where Christ`'s name is known,
and where they that meet together, worship in his name:
and of a truth none know or can worship in Christ`'s name besides these.
There have been great mistakes about worship and gatherings;
they having not been in the name and power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
but only in a profession thereof, and an imitation of things,
without the true life and power;
and what is that worship and religion in the sight of the Lord?
Now that thou mayst come into this state and learn
all these lessons of the Lord in the new covenant,
there is one thing indispensably necessary for thee; which is,
to know the hour of God`'s judgment in thy own heart,
and to lie under the judgment of the Lord, bearing it till he finish it,
and bring it forth unto victory.
For this is the way whereby he purges and redeems the soul; to wit,
by the spirit of judgment and burning.
Thou must therefore wait for, and come to feel, the Spirit of the Lord near thee,
discovering sin to thee, and revealing judgment against it,
and executing his righteous judgment upon the evil nature in thee;
that he may raise up that good and tender plant of righteousness,
out of the dry and barren ground, to which his mercy is.

Friend,
mind the words which now spring in my heart to thee (for now my heart
is open to thee in the true love and pure sense which is of God),
which are these.
If thou come to know God`'s Spirit, and to receive it, and feel it work in thee,
and its pure light shine from the fountain and spring of life,
thou wilt have a quicker sense and discerning therefrom,
than can arise either from words written, or from thoughts; that is,
the Lord will show thee the way whereof thou doubtest,
quicker than a thought can arise in thee; and the Lord will show thee evil,
in a pure sense of the new nature, quicker than thou canst think or consider of anything.
And indeed this is needful; for sin lodges in the evil nature inwardly, and works,
not so much by a known law set up in the mind, as by a secret nature;
and if it be not resisted and withstood by another nature, it can never be overcome.
Now by this judgment set up in the heart, doth God overcome and keep down sin forever;
for the judgment of God is stronger than sin,
and will bring it down where his judgment is received and abode in;
and that which brought it down, being kept to, will keep it down; and it being kept down,
life and righteousness, even the righteous life, Spirit,
and power of the Lord Jesus inwardly revealed, will be uppermost and reign over it;
and then thou shalt know what it is to be a king and priest to God,
and to come to the laver at which God`'s priests wash,
and to the blood with which their right ear, and thumb, and toe, is sprinkled,
according to the type and shadow under the law.

Perhaps these words, at present, may be hard unto thee:
but if thou come to wait on God`'s Holy Spirit,
and to the feeling of his appearance in thy heart,
and learn of him to know what is good and what is evil in thy words, ways, worship, yea,
and in thy very heart and thoughts, and also to choose the good and refuse the evil;
they will grow easier and easier, and plainer and plainer, daily,
as thou comest into the sense and experience of the things they mention.
And thou wilt find Christ, inwardly revealed in spirit,
to be very properly called the word of God,
even the ingrafted word which is able to save the soul; for he is quick and powerful,
and sharper than any two-edged sword,
able to cut down all that shall appear or rise up in the heart,
to resist or oppose his work.

The Lord so guide thee, manifest himself to thee, help thee,
and lead thee by his Holy Spirit and power,
as that thou mayst come undeniably to experience,
and to be satisfied by him about these things.
And mind not so much to know, as to be obedient and subjected to the Lord,
both in thy heart and in thy conversation also,
in the least thing that he makes manifest.
If the Lord would show thee but this one thing,--that to
use "`thee`" and "`thou`" to a particular person is proper language,
and Scripture language; and that to say "`you,`" is improper, and arose from pride,
and nourisheth pride, and so is of the world, and not of the Father;
and thou should bow thy spirit to him in this one thing,
thou little thinkest what a work it would make within thee,
and how strongly the spirit of darkness would fight against thy subjection thereto.
The Lord lead thee as he seeth good, and give thee faithfully to follow; for else,
if the Lord should lead in any thing, and thou not follow in that thing,
his Spirit would be grieved and vexed thereby,
and thy heart in danger of being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

This is from one, who wandered long in the waste howling wilderness, wayless,
from the Shepherd and Bishop of the soul; and was sorely afflicted, tossed with tempests,
and not comforted; but at length it pleased the Lord in tender mercy to visit me,
and by his own outstretched arm, to gather me into his own fold;
where I have met with the holy mount of God, and his city the heavenly Jerusalem,
and the spirits of the just men, and God the judge of all, that ever ariseth,
or can arise in the heart; and Christ the mediator, and the new covenant;
wherein and whereby he mediates; and the blood of sprinkling,
which speaketh good things to the souls that are sprinkled with it; yea, indeed,
here are all the good things met with and enjoyed, which were shadowed out under the law,
and the precious promises fulfilled,
which make partakers of the divine nature as they come to be fulfilled.

What shall I say?
The Lord knoweth that I speak these things not boastingly,
or to lift up myself above others in my thoughts,
but in tenderness and humility of heart, as before the Lord, for thy sake.
And now this is my desire and prayer to the Lord,
and the travail of my soul in his life and spirit;
even that those that are yet scattered from the fold of rest,
that the residue of the sheep of the house of Israel that are as yet lost,
as yet driven away, as yet scattered up and down in their own apprehensions, conceivings,
and several gatherings and ways of worship,
and likenesses and imitations of things without the true life and power,
may be gathered out of all these into the same life, power, and fold of rest,
into which God has pleased of his great mercy and tender goodness to gather us.
For, indeed, God`'s house and holy building is to be exalted,
and all others to be laid waste, and left desolate for the beast of the desert,
and the dragons and owls, and birds of the night (which are unclean and noisome,
and have not so much as a belief or hope to be thoroughly
cleansed by the power of the Lord here in this life,
nor ever knew what it was to bear the yoke of Christ`'s spirit and power): I say,
all others are to be left for such as these to lodge in,
and for the satyrs and dark spirits to dance in.

The Lord give thee the sense and savor of these things;
that thou mayest thereby be kindled to wait on the Lord,
to be led into the light of the living; that thou mayst live and walk with him therein,
who is, and dwells, and walks with his, in the light.
O house of Jacob! come ye, let us walk in the light of the Lord,
and let us come up to Zion, the holy hill of God, and to the gospel Jerusalem,
that there he may teach us of his ways,
and we may there learn of him to walk in his paths;
for there is the place of wisdom and true understanding,
which none know but those that are taught of God.

This is in true friendship and tender love to thy soul,
from its friend in truth and sincerity,

FRIEND,

I have had of late some deep and serious thoughts concerning thee, and a sense of thee,
as between the Lord and my own soul,
yet I have not had any thing to signify or express to thee, till this morning.
But somewhat this morning sprang up in my heart, sweetly and freshly,
which I had pure drawings to import to thee.

There was a quick sense of thee upon my heart,
and in that sense this cry was in me:--Oh! that thou wert acquainted with the pure,
eternal power of the Lord, and mightest feel his outstretched arm revealed in thee,
and witness the faith which stands in that power; and, in that faith,
believe and wait for what God is doing, and willing to do, in and for his children.
"`If ye had faith,`" said Christ, "`but as a grain of mustard seed,
ye should say to this mountain, be thou cast into the midst of the sea,
and it should be so.`" Indeed, the true faith, the pure faith, the living faith,
which stands in the power, doth remove all the mountains that are in the way,
and makes the crooked ways straight, and the rough ways plain.
If thou had lived in the days of Christ`'s flesh, and wanted outward healing,
and had been willing to come to him for healing,
but withal had not come with faith that he was able and willing to heal perfectly;
mightest not thou have missed of that cleansing and outward health and salvation,
which others met with?
For did not he say,
"`Be it unto thee according to thy faith`"? And is not he the Physician of the soul?
and is not his skill to be trusted and believed in?
He that hopeth, and believeth, and waiteth, and prayeth,
and fighteth the good fight of faith, which gives victory over sin, Satan,
and the world--he may possibly overcome; yea, he that warreth lawfully--that is,
with the spiritual weapon, which is mighty through God--he that warreth with this only,
and with this constantly, shall be sure to overcome.
For greater is He that is in the true believer, than he that is in the world.

Oh that thou mightest have experience of these things,
and witness the banner of Christ`'s love and power displayed in thee,
and the victories and conquests that are thereby,
and the safety and peace which is under it!
For of a truth, we do not speak boastingly,
but are witnesses of the majesty of God`'s love and power, which we testify of.
The Lord so enlighten and guide thee, that thou mayest obtain the desire of thy heart;
for I really believe thy desire is after holiness,
and after communion with the Father and the Son, and with the saints in light.
Oh that thou mayest be led into the pure light of life,
that there thou mayest enjoy what in this kind thou desirest!

This is from one, who singly, as in the Lord`'s sight, wisheth well unto thee.

I+++.+++ P.

Reading Jail, 27th of Eighth Month, 1670

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++.

PROFESSORS have long known the name of Christ,
and what the Scripture relateth concerning him so named;
but oh that they could once know Christ +++[+++himself,]
and receive him into their vessels, and feel life flowing from him into them!
Then would they indeed know Christ according to the Spirit; which knowledge quickeneth,
but the literal knowledge killeth.
For he that hath the Son, he that is in true union with him, and really changed by him,
so as to become one nature and spirit with him,--he hath life;
but he that hath not the Son hath not the life of the Son, nor the liberty of the Son,
but it is in the death of sin, and in service unto sin.

The directions from God`'s Holy Spirit in the Scriptures
are exceedingly weighty and precious in themselves,
and very proper to the several states to which they were given forth;
and blessed is he who is found in the practice and observation of them.
And it hath been the desire of my heart from my childhood, and still is,
that I might be found walking with the Lord,
according to what is there taught and prescribed to the children of God,
in the several foregoing ages and generations; which things were written, and are useful,
for our instruction also, being read by us, and heeded,
in that which gives the true understanding of them.

But though this was my desire, yet in my way to attain this, I missed;
for I thought that by getting the directions of Scripture into my mind,
and applying myself to the strict observation of them,
and praying for God`'s Spirit and help, I might obtain what I desired.
And truly the Lord was merciful to me, and did help me, in a great measure,
to walk uprightly and lowlily with him, and inoffensively before men;
yet not so but that I often felt the temptations
and darkness of the enemy nearer me than my rule,
and in many cases knew not what to do, nor how to be resolved from the Scriptures.

At length the Lord greatly distressed me,
and brought me to a fuller sense of my want of his Spirit and power,
and dashed all my religion in pieces; that I was just like Babylon,
for in one hour judgment and desolation came upon me; Rev. 18:10.
and I knew not what to do without the Lord,
nor which way to draw nigh to him;
but then was the Lord preparing for me that day of mercy, which since,
in his tender goodness, is broken in upon me.
And now the eye which he hath opened in me seeth,
that the gospel is a ministration of the Spirit and power of the Lord Jesus Christ;
and that he who would be his disciple indeed, must be turned to his Spirit,
and receive the immediate light and shinings of his Spirit into his vessel;
and must feel the law of life, the holy laws of the new covenant,
not comprehended outwardly in his mind,
but written inwardly in his heart by the finger of God`'s Spirit.
And being written in his heart, they have power over his heart,
and cause him to obey them; so that, being here,
he cannot possibly but fulfill the holy directions of the Scriptures,
he being in that from which they came, which reveals the substance of them unto him,
and makes them living and powerful in him.
For indeed the law of sin and death hath power over a man so long as he liveth;
but when he meets with that which kills sin and death in him,
and maketh him alive to God,
and he receives life in abundance in and through the Lord Jesus Christ;
then the fruits of life become easy and natural to him, and the fruits and ways of sin,
unbelief, and disobedience unnatural: and here the yoke is easy and the burden light,
and none of the commandments of our Lord Jesus Christ grievous.
But take them merely out of the letter, not feeling the Spirit leading into them,
and quickening and enabling to the performance of them, oh how heavy, how hard are they!
How impossible to believe aright, hope aright, pray aright, walk aright,
watch aright over the heart, fight against the enemies, lusts,
and corruptions aright! etc.
On the other hand, how pleasant is the way of life in the covenant of life,
in the power and virtue of life, and ministered from the Spirit of our God!
And here he is praised, and victory over his enemies witnessed,
and peace with him enjoyed in the pure seed of life;
blessed be the name of our God forever!
For the letter, or description of things, is not the way; but the life is the way,
the Spirit the way, the power the way, the truth as it is in Jesus the way,
which none can truly and rightly know, but as they are ingrafted into and formed in him,
and he formed in them; this is only obtained, witnessed, and preserved,
in the soul`'s union and communion with, and obedience to,
his Spirit and power inwardly revealed and made manifest.

Friend, there is somewhat further in my heart towards thee,
which I have the true and certain sense of, which is this: The Lord,
who is near thee with his Holy Spirit and power, hath been begetting life in thee,
and hath, at times, given thee a true sense and discerning, in some measure;
but there is also somewhat near thee,
which watcheth to destroy and devour what the Holy Spirit of God begets in thee,
and to beget another sense and belief in thee, different therefrom,
and indeed contrary thereto.
Now, it behooveth thee exceedingly to watch, and to pray to the Lord for help;
for the life of thy soul depends upon the one of these,
and death and destruction will inevitably break in upon thee, and have power over thee,
if thou hearken to the other.
Whom doth the enemy so much strive to devour as the sheep and inheritance of the Lord?
And they are only preserved in the Lord`'s way, and in subjection to his Spirit.
Oh, how many hath the enemy betrayed and deceived of the life
of their souls! how many men`'s spirits are now cankered,
and the good long ago eaten out of them,
who had once some tenderness and upright breathings
after the Lord! but now their silver is become dross,
and their wine mixed with water, so that the very nature and property of it is changed;
the salt having lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
I mention this to thee, that thou mayest watch and pray;
that thou thyself do not lose thy savor and sense and tenderness
which the Lord at some times kindleth in thee,
by hearkening to the subtle reasonings and suggestions of another spirit,
either in thyself or others.

This is in the nakedness of my heart, as in the Lord`'s sight,
and in the truth of friendship towards thee.

TO WIDOW HEMMINGS

FRIEND,

Well may there doubts and scruples arise in the minds of persons concerning prayer,
as they come to any sense or touch of truth from God`'s Holy Spirit;
that duty having been performed and practised so long from the fleshly mind and nature,
and not in the leading, will and compass of God`'s Holy Spirit and power.
And those who doubt therein cannot be satisfied,
till the Lord open their spirits and make the thing manifest to them;
yet this is most certain that all prayer, all true prayer to God,
is in and from his Holy Spirit;
and whatsoever is otherwise is not accepted of the Father.
The promise, indeed, is to the prayer in faith, and to the Holy Spirit;
but not to the prayer of the fleshly birth, will, or wisdom.
Therefore the great care and concern in prayer is,
that that which is of God pray unto the Father,
in the quickenings and motions of his own Spirit.
For the dead cannot praise God, nor can the dead truly pray unto him.
And truly, in the forbearing praying, there can be no peace,
for we are to pray continually; nor in praying in a formal way without life,
without God`'s Spirit--who gives to pray,
and who makes intercession--can there be any peace
within;--rather accusation and anguish to that mind,
which, desiring to pray aright, yet knows not how so to do.
But it is manifest prayer is not in the time, will, or power of the creature,
for it is a gift of God, and the ability lodges in his Spirit; it is not ours,
but as given of his Spirit, which, therefore, is to be waited upon,
when it will move and breathe in us,
and so give us the ability of calling upon the Father,
and the power of prevailing with the Father, in the name,
and through the life of the Son.

Now as to thy queries, I shall answer in plainness,
as the Lord shall please to open my heart.

As to the first:
Whenever the creature finds breathings to the Father from a sense of its wants,
these are not to be stopped, but to be offered up in that from which the breathings come.
For there is no true sense of one`'s condition, or of one`'s wants,
but from the Spirit of the Lord; and the Lord gives this sense,
that the soul might feel its need of him, and cry to him;
and every sigh and groan that is thus offered up to him is accepted of him,
and prevails with him for good towards that soul, which it shall certainly receive,
as it comes to know the Lamb of God,
and follow him in the leadings of his good and holy Spirit.
And in particular, it ought to pray for the appearance of God`'s Spirit and power;
and if it do already taste somewhat of it, it ought to pray for more of the Spirit,
and that it may distinguish the requests that rise up in the heart,
whether they come from God`'s Holy Spirit and will, or from the fleshly nature and will.
For the wrong birth also desires the kingdom, and would have the kingdom,
and prays for the kingdom, and strives for the kingdom; but it prays amiss,
and it strives amiss, even so as it never shall obtain, the kingdom being appointed for,
and given to, another.

To the second: Those that do not know, nor are sensible partakers of the Spirit,
yet feeling their want thereof, and true desires after it,
ought to offer up those desires to God; and keeping in that which begets those desires,
they shall not long be ignorant of God`'s Spirit,
but find that God is more willing to give it than
a parent to give necessary things to his children.
But those that have prayed long for the Spirit, yet have not hitherto received it,
have just cause to question the nature and ground of their prayers;
since God is so ready to give the Spirit to his children.
For doth a child ask bread of his father for many years, and not receive it?
Oh, consider this thing!
If the child ask the Spirit aright,
it is impossible but he should receive some proportion of it from the Father,
so much as is necessary to his present state.
God doth require his children to perform everything to him in and with his Spirit,
knowing they can do nothing right without it;
and surely he will not require duties of them, and withhold that from them,
without which, they cannot acceptably perform these duties to him.

To the third:
A notion that all the soul`'s supplies are from the
Father is not a sufficient ground of prayer;
for the false birth may, and often doth, pray so;
but a true feeling of the thing is a sufficient ground,
if the heart and mind keep within the limits of the feeling,
and offer up no more than what ariseth there; for truly, that is from the Spirit,
of the Spirit, and in the Spirit, wherever it is found.
And oh! that every one who hath any true sense of God might wait on him,
to savor this little which ariseth from God, from +++[+++amidst]
the multitude of his thoughts, words, and desires, which are from another root,
even from the flesh, and are of a fleshly nature, neither are of value,
nor avail with the Lord; but the birth of life, the sensible breathings of his own life,
in the poorest and weakest babe, are always of esteem, and prevail with the Father.

To the fourth: The creature may misapprehend its duty, may have a wrong sense,
apprehending that to be its duty which is not,
and may not apprehend that to be its duty which is; and so, if the sense be wrong,
then the act of obedience (according to this wrong sense) is wrong also,
and is not accepted with the Father.
It is true, prayer is of God, and is a duty; not all prayer,
but prayer after that manner that the Lord requires, which is in the true sense,
and within the limits of the true Spirit and power--praying always in the Holy Ghost.
The pure prayer, the pure breathings of God`'s child, of the true birth,
is always within the limit which God hath prescribed.
Therefore watch unto prayer,
watch unto God`'s preparing the heart by the motion and virtue of his good Spirit,
and offer up the breathings that then arise;
and wait to distinguish between the desires which arise from the fleshly part,
and the desires which arise from the spiritual and heavenly part.
For the first nature is earthly; but the second nature,
the nature which is from the second Adam, the quickening Spirit, is pure and heavenly;
and such are all the desires and breathings, that spring from that nature in the vessel.
And as thou comest into that nature, and into that Spirit from which the nature proceeds,
thou wilt truly distinguish concerning prayer, concerning faith, concerning love,
and all other spiritual things; and wilt know Him who is truth and no lie,
who deceives not, but preserves that mind which is given up to him, and abides in him,
out of all error and deceit.

Thou seemest also to be disturbed about some other duties as well as prayer.
If the Lord have begun to put a stop to the workings of flesh in thee,
and thou be subject to him therein, and cease from thine own willings and workings,
and wait on him to be taught to perform things aright, this is his love to thee;
and if thou come to feel the leadings of his Spirit further, and follow him,
thou wilt have cause to bless his name, as many others have,
whom in this day he hath thus led.
Indeed, flesh should be silent before him.
Alas! what room is there for his Spirit and power,
when there is such a multitude of thoughts, and workings, and reasonings,
such a noise of flesh in many hearts and spirits?
Happy is he who feels flesh silent, who comes to an end of his own willing and running,
though that is a time of great distress, when the full mind is emptied and brought low;
but then He that shows mercy is near, and the day of mercy is not far off to that soul.

The Lord raise up that in thee, which is of him; and so guide and order thy heart,
that it may long and cry after him, and be heard and satisfied by him.

TO ELIZABETH WALMSLEY.

MY VERY DEAR FRIEND,

Many are the trials, afflictions, and temptations,
which the Lord seeth good to exercise us with, for the purifying and making us white,
that he may honor his name in us and through us:
but this promise stands sure in the seed, "`I will never leave thee,
nor forsake thee.`" And if our God be with us and for us,
what can prevail against the work and design of his love and power towards us?

I am deeply sensible of thy condition,
feeling it even in the tender and melting love of my heart towards thee;
and this word sprang in me to thee, Look not out, but trust in the Lord,
who can make things easier than they seem likely to be;
and will certainly carry his through the hardest things which he suffers to befall them.

Oh! the Lord keep all in his pure innocency, out of the earthly, contriving wisdom,
which saith, Save thyself, avoid this dreadful brunt, this stroke of the cross;
which it is easy to hearken to, if the mind be not kept to that eye and that wisdom,
which discovers the tempter, and instructeth the bird to escape his snare.

My dear love is to thee, and to all faithful Friends.
The Lord keep you from hearkening to the enemy, and make you faithful to him,
in the pure innocency and heavenly wisdom which is of him;
for truth triumphs over deceit, and the life of the Lamb on the cross,
reigns and triumphs over death: glory to Him who hath overcome in his person,
and who teacheth us to overcome,
through faith in his power,--and from the overflowings
of the conquering life in our hearts,
which first brings down that which is contrary to truth, and then reigns in the truth.

Thy friend in the love which never dies, and in the truth which changes not,

TO ELIZABETH STONAR

DEAR FRIEND,

I am sensible that the Lord hath visited thee with his power,
reaching to thy heart in the demonstration of his own Spirit,
and that thy heart hath answered, and said in the inward of thy soul,
It is God`'s truth indeed.
Now so far as God hath reached to thee, so far it behooves thee to confess him,
his truth, and people before men,
and to give up in obedience and subjection of spirit to the Lord.
And if thou say in the simplicity of thy heart, to any that have any tenderness,
Thus it is with me; I believe from my heart this or this is of God; what shall I do?
shall I give up in obedience thereto, or shall I disobey the Lord, grieve his Spirit,
and wound my own soul?
This will reach that which is of God in any;
and this will wound and trouble that which is not of God.

The Lord guide thee, and pity thee, and help thee in thy straits, and doubts, and fears,
and troubles, both in reference to thyself and mother.
God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit, in the gospel of his Son,
that I have not sought myself, but your good; and that not of myself either,
but in the leadings and drawings of his Holy Spirit.
And I gave thy husband a warning, in true and tender love;
though I knew well enough how hard it would be to his spirit in its present state,
and what a bitter enemy he might become to me for telling him the truth.
I did it not unadvisedly, but in the weight of my spirit before the Lord;
and I heartily wish that he were not deceived in heart concerning his own state,
but truly knew it as it is.

Thy soul`'s true and sincere-hearted friend,

I+++.+++ P.

Postscript.--There is light, which enlightens the soul, or it remains in darkness:
"`Ye were darkness,`" said the apostle,
"`but now are ye light in the Lord.`" Now no man can become light in the Lord,
unless his nature and spirit be renewed, and changed out of darkness into light.
Now the question is, what this light is, and where it is to be met with.
Are the Scriptures, then, this light?
or do they testify of this light?
If they testify of this light, then, the light is to be come to,
and the soul to be enlightened by it.
And he that comes to this light, and is enlightened by it,
and walks in the pure shinings thereof, he becomes a child of light;
but he that is not enlightened and changed by it, is yet a child of darkness,
notwithstanding whatsoever he learns, professeth, or practiseth,
by imitation from the Scriptures.
This is a weighty matter.

Oh come! be not wedded to your own ways,
nor prejudiced against what God hath taught others; but let things be fairly scanned,
that all things may be proved, and that which is good held fast;
for truth will not lose ground by being tried; but darkness is afraid of the light,
because it has a secret sense that it cannot stand before it.

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++

THE enemy kindles a great distress in the mind, by stirring up an earnest desire,
and a sense of a seeming necessity to know.
When a motion ariseth, how shall I do, to know whether it be of God or no?
For if it be of God, it ought to be obeyed; and if it be not of God,
it ought to be resisted; but what shall I do, who cannot tell what it is?
I must of necessity fall, either into disobedience to God`'s Spirit,
or into the snares of the enemy.
Thus the enemy raiseth up a strength in the reasoning part, even unanswerable there.
But what if it were better for thee, at present, to be darkened about these things,
than as yet to know?
Can that possibly be?
will the strong reason readily say.
Yes, that it may, in many respects.
There is somewhat else would live and be acting in thee,
if the clear and heavenly knowledge were given; and thou wouldst be centering in self,
that which thou receivedst from God; yea, thou wouldst miss of the way of true knowledge,
and never learn in every state to be content,
nor know the pure way and actings of life in such a state.
Truly, this is not the way of the child`'s knowing; but the child knows,
in resignation and subjection of its very knowledge;
and if there appear ever so great a necessity of knowledge,
and yet knowledge be not given, it sinks in fear and humility,
into the will of the pure seed;
and there somewhat springs up (unknown to the natural wisdom,
and not in the way of man`'s wisdom),
which at seasons preserves and bears it up in such a state.
But this is a great mystery; yet sensibly experienced by the true travellers at this day.

Therefore retire out of all necessities,
according to the apprehension of the reasoning mind; and judge that only necessary,
which God, in his eternal wisdom and love, proportions out unto us.
And when thou comest hither, thou wilt come to thy rest; and as thou abidest here,
thou wilt abide in thy soul`'s true rest, and know the preciousness of that lesson,
and of whom thou art to learn it, even in every state to be content.

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++

WHAT is Paul?
what is Apollos?
or what is Cephas?
It is one and the same pure life and word of power which springs in all the holy brethren,
whom God hath sanctified and prepared to give forth the sound of his holy trumpet.
It is the Lord himself who gives forth the true and certain sound:
great is the company of those whom he hath chosen and sent forth to publish it;
none of whom can be despised in their message, without despising Him that sent them;
for he sends forth the least and weakest, as well as the greatest.

Oh, take heed of that nature and spirit in thee which desires and seeks after a sign!
It is the evil and adulterous generation which seeks after a sign.
But wait to meet with that inwardly, which changeth the heart,
and renews the mind to God; which teacheth to love the Lord God with all the heart, soul,
mind, and spirit, that so true life from and in him may be witnessed.
And as for being as one of us, thou must be formed so by the Lord,
by being inwardly changed and renewed by the Spirit and power of the Lord,
ere thou canst witness true unity with us.
If thou feel the principle of truth in thy own heart, and in that know and own us,
and so come among us, and join to us in the truth, and keep faithful to the principle,
thou wilt never be in danger of leaving us,
as they that depart from the principle in their own hearts may soon and easily do.

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++

FRIEND,

Hearken to a word of advice which is in my heart to thee; it may be of great use to thee,
if the Lord open thy spirit, and cause it to sink in.
It is this:--

Wait on the Lord, that thou mayst, from him,
feel the right limit to the mind in reading the Scriptures;
for the mind of man is busy and active, willing to be running beyond its bounds,
guessing at the meaning of God`'s Spirit, and imagining of itself,
unless the Lord limit it.
Therefore read in fear,
and wait understandingly to distinguish between God`'s
opening to thee words concerning the kingdom,
and the things of the kingdom, and thy own apprehensions about them;
that the one may be always cast by, and the other always embraced by thee.
And always wait God`'s season: do not presume to understand a thing,
before he give thee the understanding of it: and know also,
that he alone is able to preserve the true sense and knowledge in thee;
that thou mayst live dependently upon him for thy knowledge,
and never "`lean to thy own understanding.`" Little dost thou know what it hath cost us,
to have our own understanding and wisdom broken down;
and how demonstratively by this Spirit the Lord opens scriptures to us (yea,
the things themselves, which the Scriptures speak of),
ever since he hath taught us to deny our own understanding,
and to lean upon his Spirit and wisdom.

The Lord guide thee by his certain, infallible Spirit, into the certain, infallible,
everlasting way of life, that by the shinings of his light, Spirit, and power in thee,
thou mayst see light, and enjoy life.
For if thou didst certainly and infallibly understand all the words, descriptions,
and testimonies concerning the thing in the Scriptures;
yet it is one thing to understand words, testimonies, and descriptions;
and it is another matter to understand, know, enjoy, possess,
and live in that which the words relate to, describe, and bear witness of.

And friend, if thou wilt be an inward Jew, and know and understand the laws of life,
the laws of the new covenant, thou must read them in those tables,
where God writes them in and by the new covenant.
Indeed, by reading in the letter,
thou mayst read testimonies concerning the Spirit and his ministration;
but thou must read in the Spirit, if ever thou come rightly to understand the letter.
And the end of words is to bring men to the knowledge of things,
beyond what words can utter.
So learn of the Lord to make a right use of the Scriptures,
which is by esteeming them in their place, and prizing that above them,
which is above them.
The "`eternal life,`" the Spirit, the power, the fountain of living waters,
the everlasting, pure well, is above the words concerning it.
This, the believer is to witness in himself, and to draw water with joy out of it.

I+++.+++ P

TO THE FRIEND OF FRANCIS FINES

FRIEND,

After some deep exercise of spirit concerning thee, under great grief of heart for thee,
I felt a constraint of love, forcing these following considerations from me,
to lay before thee.

As for William Penn, thou didst not make mention of him to me in thy former letter.
And as to thy charge upon him,
that he denies the "`Trinity,`" redemption by Christ`'s blood, and imputed righteousness,
thou mayst read his apology touching those things,
which it is just thou shouldst seriously weigh, as in God`'s sight;
and then perhaps thou wilt not so resolutely charge him as now thou dost.

Christ is made unto us righteousness, by faith in his blood, and by faith in his Spirit;
and he that doth not believe in his Spirit,
and receives not instruction and help from his Spirit to believe,
cannot believe aright in his blood.
All that is of Christ is righteous; all that is of Christ, the righteous and holy root,
is righteous and holy, wherever it is found.
And by Christ, that which is truly holy and righteous is brought up in us,
and we forgiven and washed from our sins and iniquities for his name`'s sake.
And the receiving of the pardon of sins is precious,
and the bringing forth in the new life is precious also.

I am satisfied in God`'s Spirit,
that that which I have written in the last I sent to thee,
is the sum and substance of true religion;
the sum and substance whereof doth not stand in getting a notion of Christ`'s righteousness,
but in feeling the power of the endless life, receiving the power,
and being changed by the power.
And where Christ is, there is his righteousness.
He that hath the Son hath life and righteousness;
but he that hath not the Son hath not life nor righteousness.
And where Christ is not, there is not his righteousness; but only a notion thereof,
from apprehensions formed out of the Scriptures by man`'s wisdom,
which should be destroyed.
I would not have thy knowledge here, nor thy standing here, nor thy faith here;
but in the truth and life itself.

Christ was anointed and sent of God, a Saviour, to destroy the works of the devil,
to break down all rule and authority contrary to God in man;
for his work is in the heart.
There he quickens, there he raiseth, there he brings into death that which is to die,
raising the seed immortal, and bringing the creature into subjection to it.
Now, to feel the power that doth this, and to feel this wrought by the power,
this is far beyond all talk about justification and righteousness.
Hither would I have thee come, out of the talk, out of the outwardness of knowledge,
into the thing itself, and into the trueness of the new and living knowledge,
which is witnessed here.

There is a power in Christ to mortify and overcome sin in the very root;
it is not however overcome, but in the revealing of this power;
nor is the soul justified, but in and by the working of this power.
So that justification is not the first thing, but the power of life,
in and through which (revealed in Christ) the soul is both justified and sanctified,
through the working of the faith, which is from the power.
And here salvation is felt nigh indeed, to those that truly fear the Lord;
and glory dwells in the land which he hath redeemed.
There, mercy and truth do indeed meet together,
and righteousness and peace kiss each other.
Yea, truth, there, springs out of the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven, etc.
And here, the heavenly place in Christ is sat down in,
towards which is the travel of the disciple.
For saith Christ to his disciples,
"`I go to prepare a place,`" and "`I will come again,`" and translate you thither.
But the disciples do not come to this place before their travel,
or before any works of righteousness which God hath wrought in them.

Therefore he that will be justified by Him must abide in the faith,
where the justification is.
The Father justifies what is of his own life in the Son, and the Son in his life;
and the Son justifies what is of the Father in us (what is of the Father`'s nature,
the Father`'s spirit, the Father`'s life), and justifies us from that, by his blood,
from which we cannot otherwise be justified.
Oh, how precious it is, to see and feel this in the true light,
where the blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin!
Here is no covenant for us of ourselves to perform;
but the true self-denial is witnessed, wherein the covenant is performed;
and Christ the life, Christ the power, Christ the righteousness and wisdom of God,
working all in us; and we gathered into him, and living and working in him,
by the faith which is of him.
And here is free-will indeed, even of the will which was bound and captivated before.
And here is the election known, which obtains;
and the obedience and sufferings of Christ, not looked upon as superfluous,
but highly prized, and looked upon as of inestimable value.

Do we cry up works against the workman?
man`'s grace and righteousness against God`'s? conformity to Christ against Christ?
or make a Christ, a righteousness, a Saviour of our conformity?
Oh! how wilt thou do, when God shall plead with thee for these things?
Also that charge of thine on us, that we deny the person of Christ,
and make him nothing but a light or notion, a principle in the heart of man,
is very unjust and untrue; for we own that appearance of him in his body of flesh,
his sufferings and death, and his sitting at the Father`'s right hand in glory:
but then we affirm, that there is no true knowledge of him, or union with him,
but in the seed or principle of his life in the heart; and that therein he appears,
subdues sin, and reigns over it,
in those that understand and submit to the teaching and government of his Spirit.

But we cannot set the manhood above the life,
and make that the main or chief in the work of redemption,
and the life and Spirit of his Godhead but supporting, enabling,
and carrying him up in that great undertaking.

Consider, I pray thee, if what thou sayest be not contrary to the Scriptures?
Was the work laid by the Father upon the manhood, or upon the Son, who,
in the life and by the life, was "`mighty to save`"? Who took up the manhood?
Was it not the Son?
"`Lo!
I come,`" saith he, "`a body hast thou prepared me.`" And was it not he,
that laid down his glory, and made himself of no reputation,
but came in the form of a servant (took upon him man`'s
nature)--did not he do the work in man`'s nature?
Did not the eternal Spirit sanctify the body in the womb?
Did not the eternal Power act in him all along?
Yea, did not the eternal Spirit offer the body to God as a sacrifice?
For the manhood would fain have avoided the cup ("`Father, if it be possible,
let this cup pass from me!"`),
but the Spirit taught him to be subject to the will of the Father herein.
So that his giving up to death was rather to be attributed
to his eternal Spirit than to his manhood;
for that was the chief in the work, and not merely assistant to him.
And doth not Christ confess as much to his Father, when he saith,
"`I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do;
and now, O Father! glorify thou me with thy own self,
with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.`"
Though we are willing to honor the manhood of Christ,
with the honor which the Father hath honored it with;
yet we cannot honor it in the first place,
and attribute redemption to it in the first place,
making the Spirit and life of God but supporting, assisting, and carrying on therein.
For "`God was in Christ,`" and it was his power, life, and virtue did all in him,
as it is a measure of the same life which doth all in us;
in which measure we partake of his death, and not only so,
but also of his life and resurrection.
For he is "`the resurrection and the life,`" (which we cannot
deny) and if by his death we be reconciled to God,
"`much more shall we be saved by his life.`" And if righteousness be revealed in us,
imputed to us, and we partake of it, as we come into his death;
much more shall we partake of it, as we come into his life.

It is precious indeed to hear of Christ without;
but it is more precious to feel him within; where the wisdom of our Solomon, his love,
his riches, his treasures of life, and the glory of his kingdom, and order of his family,
and food of his children and of his servants,
are witnessed and revealed on his holy mountain;
where he makes the feast of fat things to his,
where the bread and wine of the kingdom is eaten and drunk abundantly,
and the streams of the river of his own pleasures water his garden and refresh his heritage.

I have looked over all the scriptures quoted by thee,
and find not one of them proving the thing thou assertest; that is,
attributing redemption properly to the manhood, and consequently improperly,
in the second place, only as an assistant, to the Spirit and life of the Godhead.
But if thou wouldst rightly distinguish, it were more proper to make the Word (or Life,
which was in the beginning) the agent, which did all;
and that body which the Father prepared and sanctified, the form of a servant or garment,
in and through which the life, being clothed with it, did act.
Now the Jews did disdain Christ, as a man, in that his low appearance:
therefore is the glory still given to "`the man Christ
Jesus;`" but not to take the honor from the Son,
who was God, and who saved by his Godhead, by the life, virtue, and power thereof.
"`I, even I, am the Lord,`" saith Jehovah,
"`and beside me there is no Saviour.`" The Word eternal, which made all,
redeemeth all that are redeemed: that body of flesh was that wherein he appeared.
And so what he did in it was attributed to his manhood (and the
man Christ Jesus did all that is attributed to him in the Scriptures),
but not in the first place:--thus I speak for thy sake, and sometimes, upon necessity,
to help to scatter the darkness which is seated in men`'s minds in this particular,
which is very gross; many men having heaped unto themselves dark mountains,
from their own imaginings and conceivings, upon which they stumble:
and so reading the Scriptures out of the pure life wherein they were written,
they gather not the true food, but food of their own imagining and inventing therefrom;
and so their table becomes their snare.

And whereas thou chargest us with making Christ only a pattern, not a Saviour;--indeed,
it is not so in God`'s sight; for we own Christ to be a Saviour:
but we lay the main stress upon the life, which took upon it the manhood.
And that life, wherever it appears, is of a saving nature, and doth save:
the least measure of it is of the nature of the rock,
and he proves a rock to them that feel him, and whose minds are stayed upon him.
Yet none, in the measure of this life,
can deny the appearance of the fulness of life in that body of flesh,
and what he did therein towards the redemption and salvation of mankind.

O pure,
spotless Lamb of God! how precious was thy sacrifice in the eye
of the Father! how acceptable a ransom for all mankind!
For in the free, full, and universal love of the Father, "`he tasted death for every man.`"

I+++.+++ P.

TO THE LADY CONWAY

DEAR FRIEND,

As I was lately retired in spirit and waiting upon the Lord,
having a sense on me of thy long, sore, and deep affliction and distress;
there arose a scripture in my heart to lay before thee; namely, Heb. 12:5-7. which,
I entreat thee, to call for a Bible and hear read,
before thou proceedest to what follows.

O my friend! after it hath pleased the Lord in tender mercy to visit us,
and turn our minds from the world and ourselves towards him,
and to beget and nourish that which is pure and living, of himself, in us;
yet notwithstanding this, there remains somewhat at first, yea,
and perhaps for a long time, which is to be searched out by the light of the Lord,
and brought down and subdued by his afflicting hand.
When there is, indeed, somewhat of a holy will formed in the day of God`'s power;
and the soul, in some measure, begotten and brought forth to live to God,
in the heavenly wisdom;
yet all the earthly will and wisdom is not thereby presently removed;
but there are hidden things, of the old nature and spirit, still remaining; which,
perhaps, appear not, but sink inward into their root, that they may save their life;
which man cannot possibly find out in his own heart, but as the Lord reveals them to him.
But how doth the Lord find them out?
Oh consider! his "`fire is in Zion,
and his furnace in Jerusalem.`" By his casting into the furnace of affliction,
the fire searcheth.
The deep, sore, distressing affliction, which rends and tears the very inwards,
finds out both the seed and the chaff, purifying the pure gold and consuming the dross;
and then, at length, the quiet state is witnessed,
and the quiet fruit of righteousness brought forth,
by the searching and consuming nature and operation of the fire.
Oh that thy soul may be tried unto victory over all that is not of the
pure life in thee! and that thou mayest wait to feel the pure seed,
or measure of life in thee, and die into the seed,
feeling death unto all that is not of the seed in thee! and that thou mayest feel life,
healing, refreshment, support, and comfort from the God of thy life,
in the seed;--and nowhere else, nor at any time,
but as the Lord pleaseth to administer it to thee there.
Oh! the Lord guide thee daily, and keep thy mind to him; at least,
looking towards the holy place of the springing of his life and power in thy heart.
Look unto him.
Help, pity, salvation, will arise in his due time;
but it will not arise from any thing thou canst do or think; and faith will spring,
and patience be given, and hope in the tender Father of mercy,
and a meek and quiet spirit will be witnessed;
and the Lamb`'s nature springing up and opening in thee, from his precious seed,
which will excel in nature, kind, degree, and virtue, all the faith, patience, hope,
meekness, etc., which thou, or any else, otherwise can attain unto.
Oh! look not at thy pain or sorrow, how great soever; but look from them, look off them,
look beyond them, to the Deliverer! whose power is over them, and whose loving, wise,
and tender Spirit is able to do thee good by them.
And if the outward afflictions work out an exceeding weight of glory,
oh what shall the inward do for those, who are humbly, brokenly,
and faithfully exercised before the Lord by them!
Oh! wait to feel the seed, and the cry of thy soul in the breathing life of the seed,
to its Father, with its sweet, kindly, and natural subjection to him.
And wait for the risings of the power in thy heart, in the Father`'s seasons,
and for faith in the power; that thou mayst feel inward healing,
of all the inward wounds which the Lord makes in thy soul,
through his love to thee for thy good.

If thou wilt receive the kingdom that cannot be shaken,
thou must wait to have that discovered in thee, which may be shaken;
and the Lord arising terribly to shake the earth,
and it removed out of its place as a cottage,
and the heavens also rolled up like a scroll.
And while the Lord is doing this,
he will be hiding thee in the hollow of his hand (thy mind still retiring to the seed),
and will, in these troublesome and dismal times,
inwardly be forming the new heavens and the new earth, wherein,
when they are brought forth and established, dwells righteousness.
The Lord lead thee, day by day, in the right way, and keep thy mind stayed upon him,
in whatever befalls thee; that the belief of his love and hope in his mercy,
when thou art at the lowest ebb, may keep up thy head above the billows;
and that thou mayst go on in the disciple`'s state,
learning righteousness and holiness of Him,
who teacheth to deny and put off unholiness and unrighteousness, and to know,
embrace and put on newness of life, and the holiness and righteousness thereof.

The Lord God of my life be with thee,
preserving and ordering thy heart for the great day of his love and mercy;
which will come in the appointed season,
when the heart is fully exercised and fitted by the Lord for it, and will not tarry.

I+++.+++ P.

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++

DEAR FRIEND,

Thy condition cannot but be weak and dark, until the light of life arise in thee,
and the power of the Lord overcome and subdue the power of the darkness,
which strives to keep the seed of life in the grave and bonds of death.

It is the Lord`'s mercy, to give thee breathings after life,
and cries unto him against that which oppresseth thee; and happy wilt thou be,
when he shall fill thy soul with that which he hath given thee to breathe after.
Only let thy heart wait for strength to trust him with the season;
for his long tarrying is thy salvation, and the destruction of those enemies, which,
while any strength remains in them,
will never suffer thee and thy God to dwell uninterruptedly together.
Therefore they must needs die, and He who hath the power to kill them, knows the way;
which, to the appearing of thy sense,
will be as if he meant to kill the life of thy soul, and not of them.
But lie still under his hand,
and be content to be unable to judge concerning his ways and workings in thy heart;
and thou shalt at times feel an inward leaven of life from his Holy Spirit,
whereby he will change and transform thy spirit into his likeness, in some measure,
for the present.
And though it be quickly gone again, and the whole land so overspread with enemies,
that there is no sight of redemption or the Redeemer left,
but the soul in a worse condition than before; yet be not troubled:
for if troubles abound, and there be tossing, and storms, and tempests, and no peace,
nor any thing visible left to support; yet lie still, and sink beneath,
till a secret hope stir, which will stay the heart in the midst of all these,
until the Lord administer comfort,
who knows how and what relief to give to the weary traveller, that knows not where it is,
nor which way to look, nor where to expect a path.

How shall I speak to thee, how shall I mourn over thee?
Oh that thou mayest be upheld to the day of God`'s mercy to thy soul! and be gathered,
out of all such knowledge, as thou canst comprehend or contain in what is natural,
into the feeling of life; that thou mayest know the difference,
between living upon somewhat received from God, and having God live with thee,
and administer life to thee at his pleasure; thou being kept in the nothingness,
emptiness, poverty, and perfect resignation of spirit.

This counsel is to thee, through a poor, weak vessel,

I+++.+++ P.

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++

WHO is able to undergo the crosses and afflictions, either inward or outward,
which befall those,
whom God draws out of the spirit of this world and path of destruction,
into the way of eternal rest and peace?
Yet the Lord is able to uphold that which feels its weakness,
and daily waits on him for support under the heaviness of the cross.

I know, dear heart, thy outward trials cannot but be sharp and bitter; and I know also,
that the Lord is able to sustain thee under them, and cause thee to stand thy ground;
that thou give not advantage to that spirit, which hereby would draw from the Lord,
and from the way of life and happiness.
Oh that thou couldst dwell in the knowledge and sense of this!
even that the Lord beholds thy sufferings with an eye of pity;
and is able not only to uphold thee under them, but also to do thee good by them;
and to bring forth that life and wisdom in thee by means thereof,
to which he will give dominion over that spirit which grieves and afflicts thee,
in his due season.
Therefore grieve not at thy lot, be not discontented,
look not out at the hardness of thy condition;
but when the storm and matters of vexation are sharp,
look up to him who can give meekness and patience, can lift up thy head over all,
and cause thy life to grow and be a gainer by all.
If the Lord God did not help us by his mighty arm,
how often should we fall and perish! and if the Lord God help thee
proportionably to thy condition of affliction and distress,
thou wilt have no cause to complain, but to bless his name.
He is exceedingly good, and gracious, and tender-hearted,
and doth not despise the afflictions of the afflicted, for his name`'s sake, in any kind.

This is in tender love towards thee, with breathings to my Father,
that his pleasant plant may not be crushed in thee, by the foot of pride and violence;
but may overgrow it, and flourish the more because of it.

From thy truly loving friend in the truth, and for the truth`'s sake,

I+++.+++ P.

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++

IT is of the infinite mercy and compassion of the Lord,
that his pure love visiteth any of us; and it is by the preservation thereof alone,
that we stand.
If He leave us at any time, but one moment, what are we?
and who is there that provoketh Him not to depart?
Let him throw the first stone at him that falls.

In the truth itself, in the living power and virtue, there is no offence;
but that part which is not perfectly redeemed,
hath still matter for the temptation to work upon, and may be taken in the snare.
Let him that stands, take heed lest he fall; and in the bowels of pity,
mourn over and wait for the restoring of him that is fallen.
That which is so apt to be offended, is the same with that which falls.
Oh! do not reason in the high-mindedness,
against any that turn aside from the pure Guide; but fear,
lest the unbelieving and fleshly-wise part get up in thee also.
Oh know the weakness of the creature in the withdrawings of the life!
and the strength of the enemy in that hour! and the free grace and mercy
which alone can preserve! and thou wilt rather wonder that any stand,
than that some fall.

When the pure springs of life open in the heart,
immediately the enemy watcheth his opportunity to get entrance;
and many times finds entrance soon after--the soul little fearing or suspecting him,
having lately felt such mighty, unconquerable strength; and yet,
how often then doth he get in,
and smite the life down to the ground! and what may he not do with the creature,
unless the Lord graciously help!

Oh! great is the mystery of godliness, the way of life narrow,
the travel to the land of rest long, hard, and sharp; it is easy miscarrying,
it is easy stepping aside at any time; it is easy losing the Lord`'s glorious presence;
unless the defence about it, by his Almighty arm, be kept up.
There is a time for the Lord`'s taking down the fence from his own vineyard,
because of transgression, and then the wild boar may easily break in.
Ah! who tastes not of this in some measure?
and what hinders, that he taste not of it in a greater measure?

Ah! turn in from the fleshly wisdom and reasonings, unto the pure river of life itself;
and wait there, to have that judged which hath taken offence; lest,
if it grow stronger in thee, it draw thee from the life,
which alone is able to preserve thee; and so thou also fall.

This is in dear love to thee: retire from that part which looketh out,
and feel the inward virtue of that which can restore and preserve thee.

I+++.+++ P.

TO WIDOW HEMMINGS

MY DEAR FRIEND,

Whom I have always truly and faithfully loved as in the sight of the Lord,
and to whom my love in the Lord still continues.

Since I heard of thy illness and weakness, by M. S., whom I desired to visit thee,
I have had an earnest desire to see thee; and have been considering how to effect it,
but cannot with any convenience at present, as my friend T. E., the bearer hereof,
can further inform thee.
But the desires of my heart to the God of my life are,
that he would give thee a visit in his tender pity,
and guide and help thee to stay thy mind upon himself, in his most precious truth;
of which he hath not only given thee a taste, but, many times,
a full sense and experience.

O my dear friend! that nothing might come between thy soul and God`'s truth;
that thy comfort, peace, and joy might be full,
and that thou mightst lay down thy head quietly in the bosom of Him who loves thee,
and accepts the sincere desires of thy heart towards him; as I have always told thee,
and as is still true concerning thee.
Mind not temptations nor accusations,
nor the many noises the enemy will make in thee and against thee, to the Lord;
but wait to feel truth and life springing in thy heart from the holy well,
and to hear the still voice of the Spirit of the Lord;
and he will testify his love to thee, and speak peace.

Oh! the tender bowels of my heavenly Father relieve thee;
and gather thee inwardly in thither, and preserve thee there,
where the enemy cannot break in upon thee.
Look not upon thy sins, even since thou hast known the truth,
wherein thou mightest have met with strength against and preservation from sin,
and have been in some measure blessed by the Lord; but wait to feel somewhat inwardly,
wherein God appears and breathes, and gathers, and receives, and eases of the loads,
fears, doubts, troubles, temptations, and accusations, etc.;
and the Lord God of my life and tender mercies,
which he hath made sure to my soul in the everlasting covenant,
give thee solid peace and consolation in the Son of his love,
through the measure of his grace and truth springing in thy heart,
and staying thy mind upon him.

Oh! feel the seed, and the faith which springs from the seed,
which gives victory over the enemy, and all his mysterious workings in the heart.

Thy friend, in the truest and most sincere love,

I+++.+++ P.

TO CATHERINE PORDAGE

FRIEND,

In truth of heart and tender love to thee,
it is with me to return answers to the chief passages of thy letter, as briefly as I may.

It hath not been my work, to bring thee out of esteem or into esteem of persons.
The Lord guide thee into true judgment, and keep thee out of judging,
except so far as that is raised in thee, which the Lord maketh able to judge.
But I have known several, who have spoken most gloriously and ravishingly,
as to the Scriptures, opening things even to admiration,
who have been out of the mystery of truth;
and who have sparkled with the light and life of a wrong spirit,
though they themselves knew it not to be so.

It is better with him who feels his unwillingness,
and waits to be made willing by the Lord, than with him who thinks he is willing; and,
upon his own search, finds and judges himself to be so.
I have thought I had been willing in several cases; and that,
if the Lord would have showed me his will, I should have obeyed;
which I found to be otherwise,
when the Lord came to lay the law of his Spirit and life upon me.
This I am sure of; there is that in thee, which is not willing to be impoverished,
and I cannot say concerning thee, as in God`'s sight,
that thou art yet separated from it.
Now, while it is in thee, it will be working in a mystery of deceivableness,
hidden from thy heart, which thou canst not possibly discern, but as the seed is raised,
and the pure light shines in thee.
Thou mayest easily think better of thyself than indeed it is with thee;
but it is hard for thee, in this thy present state,
to know what and how thou art in the sight of the Lord.

Thou shalt know the tenderness and melting compassion of the Lord,
when that is broken down in thee, towards which his tenderness is not,
and that raised up in thee and thy mind joined to it, towards which his tenderness is;
but great and subtle workings are there in thy mind, from the enemy,
against God`'s truth, which thou dost not discern and eschew, but rather embrace,
as if they were true and precious.
If that tenderness were ministered to thee, either from God immediately, or from us,
which thou expectest and desirest (perhaps thinking
thy state is wronged in not being so dealt with),
it might soon destroy thee, and that forever.

Thus, in great plainness, have I written to thee, and beseech thee to be willing,
or rather to look up to the Lord to make thee willing,
to have the wound kept open in thee, which the condition and state of thy soul needs;
that it may be thoroughly searched, and that which is for judgment judged and destroyed;
and so thy soul everlastingly saved by the everlasting Physician,
who is wise and skilful in ministering both judgment and mercy to every one,
according to their need.

Thy friend in true, faithful, and unfeigned love and tenderness,

I+++.+++ P.

25th of First Month, 1671

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++

Friend,

I CANNOT but write a few words in truth and innocency
(concerning the book thou sentest me to peruse),
what reception soever they may have.

As for what he writes concerning fearing God and the king;
and that God is to be feared first, and then the king; and that if God command one thing,
and the king the contrary, God is to be prefered, and the king is to be obeyed passively,
when he cannot actively; in these things I fully assent unto him,
and it is well known to have been both our principle and practice (who are called Quakers),
from the beginning, to be subject to, and obey, authority for conscience sake.

As to the Quakers, whom he stileth nonsensical, and saith,
if they had power to their wills,
they would soon lay the axe to the root of all magistracy and ministry whatsoever;
this I know to be utterly false; for we are heartily for magistracy,
as knowing it to be of God, and ordained by him to be a terror to evil doers,
and a praise to them that do well; and we love and desire magistracy,
knowing very well that miserable would be the state of mankind without it;
nor are we against all ministry whatsoever,
but greatly for that ministry which is of God, and goeth forth in his name and power,
making an effectual change in people`'s hearts, and turning them from their iniquities,
to the true sense, fear, and awe, of the Most High God.

As to his relation of the affairs of the late times,
I was observed by all sorts to be one of a retired spirit and conversation;
not meddling with affairs, covenants, or engagements,
nor taking any advantage of preferment, gain, or honour, in those times,
when thrust upon me; but mourned with those that suffered in those times,
not expecting much happiness from outward changes,
nor satisfied with any of the changes that then were.
I wish to see the change, which is not of the outward form of government,
but from unrighteousness to righteousness.

This is from one who never thought nor wished ill concerning thee,
but is a real desirer of thy good, and a well-wisher to thee, being not only required,
but also taught of God to love his enemies.

I+++.+++ P.

Reading Jail, 1st of the 2nd Month, 1671

TO CATHERINE PORDAGE

FRIEND,

I observed yesterday, that thou didst own the light to be the principle of life;
and that thou didst affirm,
that those people with whom thou walkedst also owned it and directed to it.
Now, it is one thing to own the principle in judgment; another thing to know it,
feel its guidance, and be subject to it.
It is a good step to own it in the comprehension, from the testimony without;
but yet they that go so far may never come truly to know and own the thing itself.
Now, nothing redeems, or can preserve, but the light and life itself.
Therefore, how to meet with the thing itself, and be changed by it into its own nature,
and therein to believe, know, will, understand,
and judge,--that is a skill which none can learn, but those that are taught of God,
and keep close to the foundation, not rising in the high elevations above it.
Ah, the humility of the seed, and of that soul that is one with the seed!
Ah, how low it lies, and how weighty its sense and operations are,
and how pure and infallible is its judgment!
The great danger is, in rising up above the thing itself, which whoso doth, miscarrieth,
whatever he hath formerly known or enjoyed.

There now springs up in my mind a state since Adam,
which I would have thee seriously consider of; and then tell me,
if thou hast known or heard of such another.
It is recorded in Ezekiel, 28th chapter,
of one that was "`perfect in wisdom and beauty.`" In what wisdom; in what beauty?
Let thy soul, if it hath understanding, answer.
For he had "`been in Eden,
the garden of God,`" (what! had any been so since Adam?) "`and had every precious
stone for his covering.`" What a glorious temple then was he! yea,
and he was created (by what creation?) unto this state.
Yea, he was "`the anointed cherub that covereth,`" and God
had "`set him so.`" (What is it to be the anointed,
covering cherub,
and to be so set by God?) He was also "`upon the holy mountain of God,`"
and "`walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.`" Yea,
saith the Spirit of God further concerning him,
"`Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day thou wast created.`" Yet after all this,
"`iniquity was found in`" him, and the hand of the Lord turned against him.
Answer me now; was this a state of mixture, or no?
And if so perfect a state was liable to this, what is a state of mixture liable to?

Ah! many have had some touches of the light, some true appearances thereof,
and tastes of the glory; but who hath been so united to the light,
as to keep out of all that corrupteth?
There is somewhat still lives near, that would fain be mixing with it,
and drawing higher than the pure light of life and truth; but this leads out of the way,
above the pure, the true, the innocent, the simple:
and then there is a making haste to be rich and glorious,
and a departing from that poverty of spirit, wherein is the safety and preservation.
How have some that have come among us, here split themselves by aspiring!
Ah, what a foolish thing it is, to be found singing, before dominion is witnessed,
and victory over that which captivateth: such songs will end in desolation, anguish,
and confusion; for thereby the lust of the mind goes forth, and that is fed,
which keeps from the victory and the dominion.
It is better to know the old bottle emptied, yea, broken, than filled with new wine.
And how many have taken themselves to be new made, who,
when the Spirit of the Lord hath come to search them by his pure, eternal light,
have been found and are found in the old nature and spirit!

Come, live no more, know no more of thyself;
but wait to feel the pure seed raised to live and know in thee,
and to feel its light enlightening thee, and creating a new capacity in thee;
and that will give thee to bear the pain of dying, and taking up the cross,
which will really slay every life, appearance, and power that is not of its own nature.
Thou hast formerly taken up crosses in a way of wisdom,
and according to a comprehensive knowledge and judgment; come, now,
learn to take up the seed`'s cross in the true foolishness.
For there is not another thing that gives life, than the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
which truly and really slays; and to that which can discern and take up this cross,
and live and walk under it, the yoke is easy and the burden light.
But that must first be brought under and destroyed which counteth it hard,
before it can be felt and owned to be so.
If thou couldst come out of thy own wisdom and consideration of things,
into the simplicity of the seed, thou wouldst soon recover thy lost ground again;
and see how the enemy, with his subtlety, hath gained upon thee,
and into what great danger he hath brought thy soul.

The Lord searcheth and trieth the heart, and that is the true state thereof,
which his light discovereth.
That is not the state, which the mind out of the light apprehendeth it to be,
as we have often had experience of in ourselves.
Therefore, be still; justify not thyself, nor condemn the judgment of others,
till the Lord make things manifest to thee.
If it then prove better with thee than others have said, that will be thy advantage;
but if thou then prove mistaken, and the judgment, which thou in thy heart has condemned,
should stand, it will be thy great loss and disadvantage.

This is in love and true friendship to thy soul,
in a deeper sight of thee and sense concerning thee than thou art aware of.

TO NATHANIEL STONAR

DEAR FRIEND,

There is somewhat on my heart to express to thee, in love and great good-will,
which is as followeth:--

Would it not be sad, if thou should perish from the Lord forever?
If thou err in heart from the living way, it may be so:
indeed if thy mind be not turned from darkness, inward darkness,
to the inward light of God`'s Spirit, it cannot be otherwise.
Now, if thou feel the inward light, the power of the pure light, and art changed thereby,
thou canst not speak against that light.

There was no true religion in the apostles`' days, without turning to the inward light,
and to that the true ministry was sent to turn men; nor is there any true religion now,
without being inwardly turned to and walking in the same light;
nor canst thou try any truth, or understand any scripture aright,
but in the light of God`'s Spirit.
No man can understand the things of God, but the Spirit of God.
The Scriptures are holy words, and treat of the things of God,
which no man can understand, but in a light of the same nature from which they came;
and when once a man comes to the true understanding,
he soon finds that the understanding which he had
of the same before was but after the flesh,
even short of the nature of the true understanding.
And, friend, consider if thy knowledge, which thou hast hitherto had,
hath changed or doth change the nature of thy understanding and will;
or is thy old understanding and will yet remaining,
notwithstanding all thy knowledge and practices in religion?
Oh, do not dally in things of so great concernment! lest thou repent too late;
for I do not tell thee what I see concerning thee, in the light of God`'s eternal Spirit:
but I would fain have thine own eye, or rather the right eye in thee,
opened and brought to see.

And consider one scripture seriously concerning the church of Laodicea:
had it not the true knowledge outwardly, and a true church state, and right ordinances?
Did it not believe in Christ, and look up to him for justification, etc.? Nay,
what did it want, as to the outwardness of its state?
But it wanted sense, life, warmth, inwardly.
So that, if ye had all ordinances and truths of the gospel light outwardly; yet,
if ye wanted the inward power, ye could not but want the tried gold, the white raiment,
and eye-salve: and so, though ye might think yourselves rich, etc.,
yet the shame of your nakedness would appear: yea, indeed,
the nakedness of such as are not clothed with God`'s Spirit, doth appear to the Lord,
and to the eyes and spirits of his children, which he openeth in his own light,
and who see with this eye,--I say the shame of their nakedness doth appear,
notwithstanding all the religious covers they can put upon themselves.
Oh that thou hadst desires, living desires, after the nature of truth,
and wert acquainted with the new nature,
which can be satisfied with nothing but the virtue, life, and power of truth!

Come, friend, wait on the Lord, to have the old nature, the old spirit, mind, wisdom,
understanding, and will broken, the old garment torn to pieces;
that thou mayst come to experience that which is new, pure, and living;
and find the new vessel filled with that which is new;
and know the virgin state of spirit, and the savor of the true ointment.
For life savors life, and death savors death,
and living words are but the savor of death to them that are out of the life;
and the living stone, which is the foundation of life to us, and very precious,
is but a stone of stumbling, and rock of offence, to them that are out of the life;
and who judge of things by their apprehensions of the letter,
without the Spirit of life and power.
As the Scribes and Pharisees formerly did,
and so condemned Christ in his appearance in the flesh;
those who judge after that manner now cannot but condemn
his spiritual appearance in the hearts of his children.
The letter killeth: the Spirit gives life.
If thou wilt have life, thou must come to that which gives life.
If thou wilt come into the ministration of the new testament,
thou must come into the Spirit and power; and know the letter of the Scriptures,
in the Spirit and power which wrote them, if ever thou know them aright.
Yea, if thou wilt become a son of God, thou must receive power from Christ so to do;
and if thou wilt believe aright, thou must feel faith wrought in thy heart,
by that very power which raised our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead:
all other faith falls short of the nature of true faith.

If thou receive from the Lord the true sense of these things,
thou wilt bless his name for engaging my heart to write them to thee;
but if thou read them out of that which gives the true understanding,
they cannot be of advantage to thee.
But whatever entertainment they have with thee, yet my judgment is with the Lord,
and my work and labor of love with my God, who is my strength and joy;
in whom my soul rests in peace, in the bosom of my Beloved.
And oh that thou also mightst feel quickenings of life and true leadings!
and thus be acquainted with that faithful travel which leads thither.

Thy friend in the heartiness of true love,
so far as the Lord pleaseth to make use of me towards thee,

I+++.+++ P.

Postscript.--The apostle speaks of the state of the Gentiles,
before they were turned from darkness to light,
and from the power of Satan to God! that their understanding was darkened,
being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that was in them,
because of the hardness of their heart;
not that that which might be known of God was not manifest in them;
but their ignorance was because of their hardness in not minding it, not turning to it,
and so they became alienated from the life, and their understanding not opened by it.

Now, in this state, men are without God, without Christ,
strangers to the covenant of promise, and without any true hope of salvation;
and this state, they are as really in, who get a form of godliness without the power,
as the very natural heathen.
For nothing makes a true Christian, but the life and power:
and he that doth not hear the voice of Christ`'s Spirit
in his heart is no better than a heathen and a publican.
Yea, any church, built up out of the life and power,--nay, a church,
though built by the power, yet, if not preserved in the same,
is not better than a synagogue of Satan.
They that say they are Jews, but are not so; ministers of Christ, but are not,
and do lie; alas! what are they?
Oh, how precious is life! how precious is the power of God,
in which the churches of old stood, and the true churches at this day stand!

It is precious, to know the Spirit of the living God, to be begotten by him in the life,
which is true and pure, to be separated from death and the power thereof,
and to be married to life and the power thereof,--to be married to the conquering Lamb,
who triumphed over sin and death in his body of flesh, and, by his Spirit and power,
delivers his spouse from the strength and dominion of them.
And it is precious to walk with the Lamb, and to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes;
who always leads out of sin and unrighteousness, into ways of purity and righteousness,
into the path which is prepared for the ransomed, where there is no danger of erring, no,
not so much as to the wayfaring ones, though fools. Isa. 35:8.

Oh! is it not precious experimentally to read that scripture,
and to be able in true understanding to say, The way is easy, the yoke easy,
the burden easy, the commandment not grievous;
that being brought down and subdued in me,--yea,
removed and cast out,--to which it was hard?
Alas! men building in the flesh, and after their carnal apprehensions of things,
how loathsome is it! but God`'s building,
raised in the light and life of his pure Spirit, how glorious, how beautiful, how lovely,
is it, even in the eye of God himself! "`Thou art all fair, my love,
there is no spot in thee.`" Song. 4:7. Into thy holy building,
O God! into thy heavenly building, into the spiritual Jerusalem,
which thou rearest and buildest up in the Spirit, no unclean or defiled thing can enter;
nor is there any room there for that which loves and makes a lie!
Without, indeed, are swine and dogs, vulturous eyes and crooked serpents,
who make a show of what they are not, and lay claim to that which belongs not to them;
but within are the children, within is the heavenly birth,
even the new creation of God in Christ Jesus.
For God doth not strip his people naked, and gather them out of the spirit of this world,
that they should be empty and desolate forever; but he gathers them into,
and fills them with, his own Spirit, fills them with light, fills them with life,
fills them with holiness, fills them with righteousness, fills them with peace and joy,
in believing and obeying the gospel!
And in this Spirit is the kingdom known, which is not of this world, the inward kingdom,
the spiritual kingdom, the everlasting kingdom, where the everlasting throne is near,
and the everlasting power revealed;
and the Lord God Omnipotent reigns in the hearts of his, and other lords do not reign,
but their horns are broken; and the horn of God`'s Anointed exalted,
who sits ruling as King on his holy hill of Zion; and they that have suffered with him,
and gone through great tribulation, do reign with him: blessed be his name forever!

TO NATHANIEL STONAR

IT is a dangerous thing to resist God`'s Spirit; and yet very easy for a man so to do,
who hath not received a true understanding from the Lord,
nor is acquainted with the leadings and outgoings of Him, who is pure.
He that is tender and truly sensible may discern when he resisteth, when he quencheth,
or when he grieveth the Spirit of the Lord; but he that is not truly enlightened,
nor in the true sense, cannot do so.
The Scribes and Pharisees, who were interpreters of the law,
and very strict in outward observations and ordinances, etc.,
who blamed their fathers for killing the prophets, and said,
if they had been in the days of the prophets,
they would not have dealt so with them as their fathers did: yet, concerning these,
said Stephen, "`Ye stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in heart and ears,
ye do also resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so do ye.`" For,
till the stiff will and stiff wisdom be brought down in a man,
he cannot but resist God`'s Spirit, and fight for his notions and practices,
according to his apprehensions of the letter,
against the testimony of God`'s spirit and power.

Paul, who walked, according to the letter of the law, blameless,
yet resisted the Spirit which gave forth the law.
He must know the Spirit, receive the Spirit, live in the Spirit, walk in the Spirit,
and not fulfill the lusts of the flesh, who would not be found resisting God`'s Spirit.
He who is indeed turned to the redeeming arm, to Christ, the power of God,
and gathered into the power, and dwelleth in the Spirit and power of the Lord Jesus,
and is taught and led by him from path to path, and from pasture to pasture, as the Lamb,
the Shepherd, goes before and guides him,--he is preserved from grieving the Holy Spirit,
which moves and draws, instructs and quickens, all that are born of God.
But he that is only in the letter, and in the form of godliness,
out of the inward life and power, he is of that birth, mind, nature, and spirit,
which cannot but resist God`'s Spirit.
He knoweth not, he heedeth not, His drawings, His movings; His light,
His life,--the way thereof,--either in his own heart, or in the hearts of others;
and so walks in a way of rebelling against, and resisting Him,
who is the only Saviour and Redeemer of the soul.
See Job 29:3-4. and 24:13. Oh that thou mightst learn to wait aright to learn these
things! and come into the true sense and discerning of the Spirit and power of the Lord,
that thou mightst not any more resist it, neither in thyself, nor in others.

The Lord open thy heart, and lay thy spirit low before him;
that thou mayst come into a right sense and judgment,
concerning the state of thine own soul;
and mayst experience the Lord manifesting things to thee, as indeed they are.

Postscript.--O FRIEND!

Wait to receive an understanding from the Lord, that thou mayst come truly to know,
whether thou hast resisted God`'s Spirit, or no;
that thou lose not the advantage of making peace with thy adversary,
while thou art in the way with him.

I would not have thee deceived about that virtue, life and power, which redeems the soul.
For there is no other Redeemer, besides the Lord Jesus Christ,
and he redeems by the grace of his Spirit, and by faith in his blood,
which cleanseth from sin;
which blood is sprinkled on the consciences of those
that believe,--and that not in the darkness,
but in the light; as is said in 1 John 1:7. "`If we walk in the light,
as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another,
and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin.`" Under the law,
the blood of bulls and goats was sprinkled outwardly, on the outward things,
which sanctified to the purifying of the outward things; but under the gospel,
the blood of the Lamb is sprinkled inwardly, upon inward and heavenly things.
See Heb. 9:13-14. and 22,23. and chap.
10:22. and 12:24. Oh that thou didst truly and understandingly know the difference,
between thy own applying Christ`'s blood to thyself,
and the Lamb`'s sprinkling it upon thee, and washing thy soul therein! Rev. 1:5.
and also between thy own believing,
according to thy own apprehension of things,
and his giving thee to believe in the light of his
Spirit! and between thy own praying in thy own spirit,
and his giving thee to pray in his Spirit!

Ah! the Truth of our God is precious! the knowledge of his Christ, precious!
It is a precious thing, to have the Son revealed by the Father to the renewed mind.
God himself is the teacher, in the new covenant,
of all the true disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ;
and oh how do the teachings of his Spirit differ,
from all the knowledge and learning men can attain unto of themselves!
The Lord give thee the true understanding;
and to know what it is to begin thy religion in his Spirit;
and batter down and bring to nought the understanding in thee which is not true;
that thou mayst not find thy soul deeply deceived at last,
as to the true knowledge of Christ and mysteries
of God`'s kingdom,--and so perish forever!

This, in very dear, true, and tender love, from him,
who most sincerely and heartily wisheth well to thee.

TO CATHARINE PORDAGE

FRIEND,

It is true, the way to life is so difficult and intricate, that none can find it,
but such as are lighted by the Lord, and follow the guidance of his Spirit.

Christ, who preached the kingdom, and bid men seek it, yet said,
"`Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life,
and few there be that find it.`" In a race many run, but one obtaineth the prize.
Canst thou read what Christ said, "`Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man,
and drink his blood,
ye have no life in you`"? that seemed a hard saying to some of his own disciples,
many of whom left him.
And truly, friend, as it is not an easy thing to come into the way,
so neither is it an easy thing to abide in the way; for many are the by-paths,
many and great the temptations, both on the right hand and on the left.
The way was always the same, full as difficult and hard formerly as now;
but the states and conditions of some make it harder to them than it is to others; yea,
it is easier now than it hath been in many foregoing generations,
being prepared and cast up by the Lord.

It is sad indeed that any should be convinced of truth,
and not come into subjection to it; yet it is very easy and common.
For men cannot withstand conviction, when it comes in power;
but they may deny obedience to that which they are convinced of; nay,
some in the apostles`' day went further, even to taste of the heavenly gift,
and powers of the world to come, and to partake of the Holy Ghost, and yet fall away.
Was not this very sad?
and yet this was no well-grounded objection against the truth and way of God then.
Indeed, I make little of the illumination of the understanding,
without subjection to him that illuminateth, in those things wherein he illuminateth.
But that is a great mistake, to suppose I did condemn any waiting or praying,
that is according to a true illumination and leading of God`'s Spirit;
for the true light and Spirit are not separated;
but the exceptions I have against the prayers of professors is,
that they are so much out of the true illumination, in a light of their own apprehending,
forming, and conceiving.
Now these are but the limits of the fleshly birth,
out of which comes nothing that is pleasing to the Father.

Did I, or any of us, ever affirm,
that the forbearance of the means was the way to attain the end?
But the setting up or using a false means is not the way to attain the true end.
"`So run,`" said the apostle, "`that ye may obtain.`" Did he not forbid all running,
but the right running?
The praying of the fleshly birth, or in the will,
and according to the wisdom of the flesh,
is not the means or way to obtain the everlasting kingdom;
but the prayers of the true birth are.
And if I should say thus again and again to thee, So pray,
as that thou mayest obtain what thou prayest for, I should not be thine enemy therein;
for it is easy asking amiss, not so easy to ask aright.
Prayer is a gift; and he that receiveth it,
must first come to the sense of his own inability, and so wait to receive;
and perhaps begin but with a groan or sigh from the true Spirit,
and thus grow in ability from the same Spirit,
denying the ability which is after the flesh: this latter abounds in many,
who mistake and err in judgment, not waiting on the Lord,
to be enabled by him rightly to judge and distinguish between flesh and spirit,
but are many times willingly ignorant in this particular,
it will cost so dear to come to a true understanding therein.

Hath not all flesh had some manifestation of God`'s Spirit allotted it?
was not that which might be known of God manifest in the Gentiles?
and ought not all flesh, in that, to call upon the Lord,
as the true sense is given them therefrom?
But because of this, might the heathen pray according to their own imagination?
Is there not a rule of prayer?
Is not God`'s light, God`'s gift, God`'s Spirit, the rule to all?
Is any prayer required or accepted out of this?
Indeed, he that hath the sense of being but a dog, as I may say,
and not worthy to be counted a child, yet may pray for crumbs, and be heard,
and receive them.
But what are prayers, out of the light and life of God`'s Spirit?
are they not prayers of the fleshly birth, fleshly will, fleshly wisdom?
can they that are in the flesh, or pray in the flesh, please God?
Oh, forsake thy own wisdom, reasonings, will,
and desires! that thou mayst come to true understanding in this particular.

As to stirring up the gift, 2 Tim. 1:6. Paul knew to whom he wrote:
Timothy had a great understanding, and both knew the gift, and how to stir it up;
but he that hath not a true understanding, may stir up somewhat else,
instead of stirring up the gift, and so kindle a fire of his own,
and offer up his own sacrifice, with his own fire,
neither of which are acceptable to the Lord.

The troubled soul is not only to go to the Lord, but it must be taught by him,
how to go to Him.
The Lord is the Teacher; and this is a great lesson,
which the soul cannot learn of itself, but as it is taught by him.
Men abound in their several ways in religion,
in that which God is arising to scatter and confound;
so that it is not the great and main work to be found doing,
but to be found doing aright, from the true teachings, and from the right Spirit.

In the time of great trouble, there may be life stirring underneath,
and a true and tender sense, and pure desires,
in which there may be a drawing nigh and breathing of heart to the Lord; but,
in the time of trouble and great darkness, may not a man easily desire amiss,
and pray amiss, if he have not his Guide?
A little praying from God`'s Spirit, and in that which is true and pure,
is better than thousands of vehement desires in one`'s own will, and after the flesh.
For as long as a man prayeth thus, that which should die in him,
lives in his very prayers; and how shall it ever be destroyed,
if it get food and gain strength there?
But life and virtue may be felt, and that which troubleth be near too,
and greatly troubling.
Did Christ feel neither life nor virtue, in the time of his great trouble?

We neither lay weight on outward things, as considered in themselves,
nor take off from the inward.
Ah! consider what spirit this charge comes from; and if thou discern it,
take heed of joining to it, and bringing forth the fruits of it any more.
What if God hath chosen weak and foolish things to the eye of man`'s wisdom, now,
as formerly?
Do we, in so testifying, lay any more weight thereupon, than God layeth?
And what if God hath thrown by all preachings, prayings, singings (yea inward),
which are not in his Spirit, but from the transforming spirit and birth.
Do we herein debase, or testify against, any thing that is inwardly of God?
The outward which is right in God`'s sight, must come from the inward,
but not from the inward will or wisdom of the flesh,
but from the inward light and Spirit of God;
but it is a great matter to receive singly and go along with the inward light,
and avoid the inward, deceitful appearance of things.

There is one thing hath been with me all along still, throughout thy letter,
even a cry to thee for obedience, obedience to the Spirit and power of the Lord;
and to consider,
whether disobedience hath not drawn this darkness and power of the enemy upon thee.
It is not thy proper work, to look out at the way,
or think it hard (for it is not so to the true seed),
but to be travelling in faithfulness, as thou art drawn and led;
and this will save thee much sorrow.

As for Christ being a mediator and Reconciler, it is by his death and life;
both of which are partaken of, in the light which comes from him,
even in the grace and truth which he dispenseth.
For as God wrought all in him by the fulness which he bestowed on him,
so he works all in his by a measure of the same Spirit, life, and power.
But why dost thou so desire to be able to comprehend and
reason about these things?--that is not thy present work,
but to feel after and be joined to that, whereby Christ reneweth and changeth the mind,
and wherein he gives the knowledge of his good and acceptable, and perfect will.
Take heed of being exalted above measure,
or desiring to know the things of the kingdom after the flesh;
for it is better to lie low, and as a child to enter the kingdom,
and to receive the knowledge of the things of God there,
than to be feeding that knowing mind, which is to be kept out and famished.

Ah! watch, that thou mayst not lose thy Leader, and meet with the deceiver,
instead of Him that is true; and so go back from light, life, truth, and power,
instead of going forward toward them.
Indeed, this letter of thine makes me afraid, as Paul speaketh to the Galatians,
lest I have bestowed labor on thee in vain; for there seems to me to be in thee,
a strengthening of thy mind towards returning back to that,
from which the Lord in his mercy hath been redeeming and gathering thee.
If thou feel the right seed, and come to be of the right seed,
the way of the seed will not be too hard for thee; otherwise it will.

This is to thee, in love and grief, from thy soul`'s true friend,

I+++.+++ P.

21st of Sixth Month, 1671

TO CATHARINE PORDAGE AND ANOTHER

FRIENDS,

Take heed of that spirit,
which will be stirring up hard thoughts in you of God and his way,
and the faithful testimony thereof, when, in the tender mercy of the Lord,
it is given forth to you; for that spirit is your souls`' enemy.
Wait, therefore, to know in yourselves that which is to stumble, and fall, and be snared,
and broken, and taken; for it cannot receive God`'s truth.

And take care of that spirit which hateth reproof;
for the reproofs of instruction are the ways of life, and whom the Lord loves,
he rebukes and chastens.
And truly, friends, this is God`'s truth in my heart to you both, this morning:
the ministration of conviction and reproof is that which ye are to come under;
and it is your proper state to wait daily, not for comforts,
not for refreshments (that day is to come afterwards),
but for convictions and reproofs of that in you which is contrary to God.
And if ye walk faithfully in this dispensation, ye shall in due time know another,
when the work of this is over; for really, friends,
ye must be emptied of that wherewith ye are now filled,
before ye can be filled with that which is true and living.
If I should say one word to you, could ye bear it?
and yet this counsel is with me towards you: Oh! wait for, receive, embrace, be glad of,
that which reproves you, and be afraid of that which comforts you in your present state;
for ye are to come through the trouble, judgment, breaking down, plucking up, consuming,
and burning of the contrary nature and spirit, which yet deceives you;
and to witness all the knowledge, profession, practices, beliefs, hopes,
that are founded there, and spring up thence, confounded and destroyed,
before ye can possibly come into the true ministration of life and power.
Ye must die to your own wisdom, if ever ye will be born of and walk in the wisdom of God.
Yea, ye must die to that part, that is so active from and in that wisdom,
and which would be laboring in the very fire for what is but vanity,
if ye will receive the knowledge, which springs out of truth and life itself,
which indeed flows over and covers the earth of God`'s heritage,
as the waters cover the sea, in this day of his great goodness and plentiful redemption.

When we were in desolation and great distress, indeed, unutterable,
we had none of these helps and instructions, which abound towards you.
Oh, what a day of mercy have you met with! and how great will be your condemnation,
if ye become as deaf adders to the Spirit of the Lord, and so miss of his salvation.
And if ye will ever know the Spirit of the Lord, ye must meet with him,
as a searcher and reprover, in your own hearts; yea, the merciful God must ye meet with,
as a severe Judge, and unquenchable, consuming fire against that spirit, wisdom,
knowledge, and faith in you, which is but of a chaffy nature.
Truly, friends, it is far better to be stripped of it,
than to find any rest or pleasure in it.

Oh, hear the voice of the living God!
His word is nigh, nigh you; and his word hath a voice that speaks.
Oh that the ear that can hear might be opened in you! and the ear
stopped which will not cannot hear the voice of the Shepherd!
Oh, wait for the Reprover! and turn the ear to him, letting in his reproofs,
and turning from what he reproves for, without murmuring, without disputing;
and the exercise of that ear will open it more and more:
so that ye will come to know the voice more and more; which,
though it prove very bitter to that which is of a contrary nature,
and would not hear the voice, yet will be sweet, yea, sweeter and sweeter daily,
to the true birth.
And here, ye will witness true death to that which is to die; and true life,
ministered by Him who lives forever, to that which is to live.

But while ye are striving to comprehend, and to begin obedience after that wisdom,
ye will find the power, which opens to others, shutting you out from that which is true;
and yourselves liable to be tempted,
and persuaded to esteem and take up that which is false, instead of that which is true.

What spirit is that in you, which prejudices your hearts inwardly against,
and makes you apt to cry out +++[+++because]
of, destroying?
Is it not that spirit, which would save alive what is to be destroyed in you,
that your souls might live in and to God?
The Lord discover to you, how the enemy works in you,
against the life and salvation of your souls;
for he knows what will be the issue of this destroying work,
if it have its thorough course and effect upon you;
and that none of his kingdom will be left standing in you.

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++

DEAR FRIEND,

Some Scriptures did spring up and open in my heart towards thee this morning.

One was, that of 2 Cor. 10:4-5, and 6. That which was chiefly on my heart therefrom,
was about the fulfilling of obedience.
First, there is a knowing the will of God; a waiting to know and understand from God,
what is his holy, good, perfect, and acceptable will.
Then, as God gives the knowledge, he requires obedience;
which is to be learned of God in the new spirit and life.
For in the old nature, mind and spirit, there is nothing but darkness and disobedience;
in the new creation is the new obedience.
So that there is first a beginning of knowledge in the Spirit,
a beginning of faith in the renewing power,
and a beginning of obedience (in the same) to him that calls.
Then there is an increase of knowledge, of true, pure, living knowledge,
an increase of faith, and a growing more and more obedient under the exercises,
judgments and chastisements of the Father`'s Spirit: even till, at length,
the soul comes to witness a full readiness, skill, and strength (in and through Christ,
in and through the measure of the gift of grace received from him),
to obey in all things.
When the new birth is thus grown up into strength and dominion,
into the stature of a man in Christ; then the senses,
which have been long exercised in discerning between good and evil, grow strong:
and there is a quick discerning in the fear of the Lord,
and an authority in his name and power, over the enemy and his temptations:
so that every strong hold is broken down,
every imagination and false reasoning concerning the truth,
is subjected and broken by the evidence and power of truth, every thought brought under,
into captivity, even to the obedience of Christ;
with a readiness to reject all unbelief and disobedience,
that will so much as offer to rise up.
Now, is not this the Christian state, which God would have his children aim and strive at?
and are not they blessed who witness it;
and doth not the true ministration of the gospel light, Spirit, and power lead to it?
and should any be at rest in their spirits, in an easeful, formal, dry,
dead profession without it?

Another Scripture was 1 Pet. 2:2-4,
and 5. It is precious to witness the state of a new-born babe,
to be begotten to God by the word of life and power,
even by the word which God ingrafts into the heart.
Oh, what living desires then are there after that which nourisheth the birth of life,
which God breathes from his own Spirit, and begets the soul into!
Now as the birth is pure,
so the nourishment is pure--pure milk from the pure word,--sincere,
unmixed milk from the word of life,--from the breast of life.
Who is it that begets to God?
It is the Spirit, the Word, the second Adam, he whose name is the Word of God.
Who is the mother of these children?
It is the heavenly wisdom, the Jerusalem which is above.
("`Jerusalem which is above is free,
which is the mother of us all.`" "`Wisdom is justified of her children.`") Now,
who feeds these children?
who nourisheth, who brings them up?
Why, the mother which bare them, she holds forth the breast of life to them,
she yields to them the pure milk of the word.
The new-born babes, they long for it, they cry for their food,
they earnestly desire after it; and the tender mother gives it forth to them,
even the milk of the breast of life from the pure word of life; and by this they grow.
But how came the babes to desire after such pure, sincere, unmixed food?
Oh! they have "`tasted that the Lord is gracious.`" They have had the heavenly taste,
they have tasted that which was living and pure from God,
from his tender mercy and grace, wherein he ministers life and salvation.
Oh, the remembrance and sense of the sweetness of this is upon their palates!
Oh, how precious and living is it,
when it comes new and fresh from him! the words which he speaks,
they are still spirit and life to the soul.
How can they but desire, that from the breast of life,
from the heavenly wisdom and divine knowledge of his Father,
he would minister unto them of the pure food,
that they may know and feed on the truth as it is in Jesus?
Here they come to him as unto a living fountain, and a living stone, disallowed indeed,
and rejected of the builders after the flesh, in all ages and generations;
but chosen of God, and precious to all that have the true sense and understanding.
They come thus to him daily, and so are built up into a living house,
or spiritual temple and dwelling-place for God.
He, the foundation stone, the corner stone, the top stone,
the hope and crown of their glory; they, living stones in him,
quickened and kept alive in and by him, and shining in his light and glory.

A third Scripture was Eph. 6:10-12, and 13. Is not this a precious state,
to be "`strong in the Lord and in the power of his might`"? to know "`the whole
armor of God,`" and to put it on and stand armed against the strength of the enemy,
and to overcome him?
was there ever such a state witnessed?
Yea: John writeth to the young men in his time,
because they had "`overcome the wicked one.`" (Compare 1 John 2:14,
with Eph. 6:10) May not such a thing be again witnessed, even now, in these our days?
Were not he a messenger of good tidings to thee, who from God could tell thee,
how thou mightest come to know, to put on, to fight in this holy armor,
and thereby overcome all the adversaries of thy soul?
Doth not the apostle say,
"`The weapons of our warfare are mighty through God`"? Wouldst
not thou be willing to witness them so in thee?
Mind then, in the measure of life,
in the measure of grace and truth which is from Christ, all the knowledge, strength,
and use of the armor lie.
Thus the truth as it is in Jesus is the girdle of the loins; and from and through him,
in his pure measure of life, righteousness springs up as a breastplate.
There likewise, the feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; for there,
the gospel, the life, the redeeming power and virtue is always in readiness,
whenever the Lord seeth service for it.
And then, the shield of faith is known,
which quencheth the fire of the enemy`'s temptations.
There also is the helmet of salvation, the true hope; for in it, Christ,
the hope of glory, is revealed, and felt to be near.
And then, the sword of the Spirit is witnessed, which is the living Word,
the Spirit which quickens and gives life; which Word is quick, piercing,
and exceeding powerful, able to smite and wound death.
(See Rev. 1:16. Isa. 27:1. and 11:4. and 2 Thess. 2:8) And here,
is pure praying in the Spirit of the Lord Jesus,
and watching thereunto with perseverance, both for itself in particular,
and the whole body of the faithful in general; but for those more especially,
on whom lies the weight of the service in and towards the body: so that here,
is prayer in its due season, weight, and order offered up to God,
in true life and understanding: which prayer God always heareth.

Oh, mind this thing diligently, for it is of great concernment to thee!
In the grace of the gospel, in the measure of truth and life from the quickening Word,
thou meetest with the whole armor of God.
Thou mayst there know it, thou mayst there put it on, stand armed with it,
and fight with success against the soul`'s enemies.
Out of this, thou mayst get apprehensions in thy mind about it,
but canst never truly know it, canst never come at it, or be covered and armed with it,
to stand and fight successfully and victoriously against the enemies of thy soul.

Ah! little dost thou know the lovingkindness of
the Lord in visiting thee with his truth,
in giving thee a sense beyond others, in so tenderly drawing and inviting thy heart;
or what this will come to, if thou faithfully give up to hearken to and follow him.

TO ANN FLEETWOOD

My dear Friend, my ancient Friend,

AH,
hadst thou known the precious appearance of the spirit and power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
as it has broken forth in many spirits in this our day;
blessed be the name of our God forever; I say hadst thou known it, and embraced it,
and followed the Lamb faithfully in the light and leadings thereof, ah,
what mightest thou have attained to in the life and
truth of righteousness before this time!
Indeed thou mightest have been established in the place which the Lamb gives;
and in his unspotted righteousness, which flows in as a river, and like waves of the sea,
upon his seed and offspring.
O, blessed be the Lord our righteousness, and holy Redeemer, forever; for indeed,
dear Ann, he that once appeared outwardly, doth now appear inwardly;
and he doth those works inwardly (at and by his inward appearance),
which he gave signification of, in his outward appearance; and, O,
that as thy soul needeth, so it might partake thereof.
I can truly say,
in the sight of the Lord God who hath created me
anew in Christ Jesus (blessed be his name,
O, blessed be his name),
that I knew a true birth from the holy seed of life in the days of my former profession;
and that it was this birth which Christ visited in me,
after many sore travails and grievous desolations, by his fresh and living appearance;
in which my soul has felt redemption and washing,
through the blood of the everlasting covenant; and that in and through this appearance,
power is given to become sons; and we are made kings and priests to God,
in and through his Son;
and the holy sacrifices are offered up in the life which is eternal;
and the holy dominion over sin and death is partook of,
and he that led captive is led captive, and his strength broken: O, blessed be the Lord,
for indeed our hearts are filled with blessings and praises to the God of our life,
in and through the name of his Son, who lives in us: and because he lives, we live also.
The Lord knows that I speak not these things boastingly,
but in fear and reverence towards him, and in humility of heart,
and meltings of spirit before him:
and indeed we are required of God to speak of his power,
and of the wonderful works which he hath wrought, and daily worketh, thereby inwardly.
O, my friend, that thou knewest thy Lord and Saviour as he now appears.
Why, through mistakes and prejudices, shouldest thou think hardly of him?
He is Lord of the sabbath;
he is Lord and commander over all outward ordinances whatsoever;
he is not a transgressor in making or causing any shadow to fly away;
but a fulfiller of his Father`'s word and counsel, in shaking what is shakeable,
that that, which cannot be shaken, might remain in his Father`'s kingdom forever.
And indeed an entrance into the everlasting kingdom is administered,
and the holy disciples (which are washed with the pure water) enter thereinto;
and the bread of the kingdom is eat of, and the wine drunk of; and that which is living,
and pure of God, feeds on the pure sincere food of the word of life,
which lives and abides forever; which is above all words that ever were spoken,
or can be spoken concerning him.
The words concerning the manna (even such as come from him who is the manna),
are one thing; the manna itself, another.
O, that thou knewest my voice; shall I say,
if thou knewest the Shepherd and Bishop of the soul, thou wouldest know my voice,
because it is not mine, but the voice of the Shepherd in me and through me.
I do not say that every word I speak is the voice of the Shepherd;
but indeed the words which spring from his life in me,
and which his life and power gives forth, are no less.
O, that thou knewest the appearance of him which lives forever;
and what it is to eat his flesh, and drink his blood,
that thou mightest become flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone,
and feel full and true unity with him, and abundance of life from him.

I have had great travail and living breathings for thee; one while,
that thou mightest know the Truth, the living Truth, in power as it is in Jesus;
another while that that, which I formerly knew to be in thee,
which hath long languished for want of the true ministration of life and power,
I say that that, might secretly be kept alive,
in the midst of the many temptations and darknesses which thou meetest with.
Well, this I have had a deep sense of, long, concerning thee, namely;
that thou wantest the help of the Lord, and the comforts of his Spirit,
more than thou art willing should be took notice of.
O, that thou mightest meet therewith; and, for that end,
that thou mightest be led by the Lord into the way (even into that inward
way of light and life) wherein thou shouldest certainly meet therewith.
This is in friendship, and in that love of the Lord Jesus Christ to thy soul;
though thou (through mistake and error of judgment) greatly fallest short in love to him,
his Truth, and people.

From thy soul`'s true friend, and most hearty well-wisher,

I+++.+++ P.

P.S. The way of God, and covenant of life,
is but one and the same throughout all ages and generations;
but it hath been variously made manifest.
And the same thing (even the same word of life which was from the
beginning) which was held forth in the Apostles`' days,
is also to be held forth after the apostacy, in a seeming different sound of words,
to what was then preached, according as was foretold, Rev. 14:6-7.
For though it be the same gospel (being
the everlasting gospel which is then to be preached),
which was preached before (in Abraham`'s, the holy Prophet`'s, Christ`'s,
and his Apostles`' days ); yet the sound of it is so ordained by God to be given forth,
and seemeth so different as to the words of expressing it,
that none but such as are taught of God, can know it,
for it is to go forth after this manner, or to this effect, Fear God,
and give glory to him; worship the Creator; be sensible of the hour of his judgment,
which is come.
Now in this manner the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ is preached in this our day,
and they that are taught of God know the sound thereof.
Others cannot know it, but set up the letter, instead of the spirit; words,
instead of the thing itself;
and so err and mistake both concerning the Scripture written formerly,
and also concerning the present appearance of life and power itself.

O, consider, I beseech thee, in the fear of the most High God,
if the gospel be thus to be preached after the apostacy, by the ordination of God;
and if it be thus preached in this our day;
then they that receive this message in the authority and power of it,
receive the everlasting gospel; and they that through prejudice and mistake reject it,
reject the everlasting gospel and tidings of salvation,
and the spiritual appearance of the Saviour;
and whatever men may profess concerning Christ, and his former appearance in the flesh;
yet thus turning against the life and power of the Lord,
and the holy message of salvation, as now preached by God`'s holy Spirit,
the life and power turns against them,
and they are shut up in darkness (in that which in God`'s sight is darkness),
and meet not with the light of the living.
Ah, what a difference there is between men`'s apprehendings and conceivings,
upon the holy words of the Scripture, and God`'s leading the soul into Truth,
and evidencing the mysteries of life and salvation,
in the light and demonstration of his own Spirit.
He knows Christ indeed, who knows him a mystery of life in him,
and feels life springing up from the holy seed in him, in a mysterious way,
hid from the eye of his own wisdom.
These things sprang livingly in me this morning towards thee,
and they are laid before thee in the melting tenderness of true and unfeigned love.

I+++.+++ P.

9th of 5th Month, 1672

TO WIDOW HEMMINGS

THERE are two or three scriptures now on my heart to lay before thee;
and it is the desire of my soul, that thou mayst so know the Lord,
and so receive his Son, as that thou mayst experience them.

The first is in Prov. 5:15: "`Drink waters out of thine own cistern,
and running waters out of thine own well.`"

The second is the words of Christ: John 7:38. "`He that believeth on me,
as the scripture hath said,
out of his belly shall flow rivers (or streams) of living waters.`" For
"`there is a river the streams whereof make glad the city of God.`"

The third is that of John 4:14. where Christ signifies,
that whosoever drinketh of the water which he giveth,
shall never thirst more after water from without,
but shall forever thenceforward be satisfied with
the springings up of the well of life from within.

To these I may add the precious promise of the sweet state of the gospel: Isa. 12:3.
"`Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.`"
The outward Jew drew the outward water from the outward wells:
they had the upper springs, and the nether springs outwardly; but the inward Jew,
in the light of the gospel day, draws inward water out of the inward wells with joy.
The thirsting after it, when the soul could not meet with it,
was a time of great sorrow and perplexity; but when the river of life is found,
when the well of life is received, and the water springs up,
the soul draws it from the spring, and drinks it with unspeakable joy.
This metaphor, or similitude, is explained by the evangelist John, in chap.
7. ver. 39. The receiving of the Spirit, the receiving of the substance,
belongs to the Christian`'s state,
as the receiving of the figures did to the Jew`'s state.
When the Spirit is received, the river, the well of life, is received;
and then the waters thereof flow, and are drawn and drunk of.
Now, the primitive Christians did receive the Spirit,
not only in gifts and manifestations,
but as a fountain of life and heavenly virtue dwelling within them. Rom. 8:9.
And as he dwelt in them, so life sprang up from him,--peace, joy,
knowledge, virtue, wisdom, power, etc.;
even the peace which passeth all man`'s understanding,
and joy which is unspeakable and full of glory.
The presence of God was with these, and they knew the times of refreshment,
even the times of consolation from the holy Comforter.

These things are witnessed now again, in the preaching of the same everlasting gospel,
by the same eternal Spirit and power which preached it at first.
For though the vessels in which the power appears are contemptible now,
to the professors and wise ones of this age, as they were then,
to the professors and wise ones of that age;
yet it is the same treasure of life which is hid, and at times is made manifest,
revealed in and through the earthen vessels:
blessed be the Lord! of whom is the excellency of the glory, and not of us,
who are but instruments and vessels in his hand.
Now, seeing the Lord hath given us to partake of the riches of his grace,
and of the precious treasures of life in his Son, and of his everlasting kingdom,
we cannot hold our peace; but are required of him to proclaim the day of the Lord,
the day of the gospel, even the everlasting day, which never shall have an end;
and invite to the waters of life, the pure, still streams of Shiloh,
which our souls drink of, and are satisfied with;
especially to such as now thirst after them, as our souls once vehemently did,
and were near failing through the extremity of thirst; which thirst, or desire,
for the nature of it (blessed be the Lord!), is not lost or extinguished, but satisfied.
And so the spouse having heard the Spirit inviting to the waters,
being taught by Him to come to and drink of the living streams,
daily also enjoying life and sweetness therefrom,--now she cries also to her fellow travellers,
to the weary and thirsty ones: Oh come, saith she, to the fountain of life,
which I mourned after, and languished for want of! oh, taste the sweetness of my Beloved,
for whom my soul fainted, when I could not find him!
So that not only the Spirit of the living God saith, Come; but the bride also saith,
Come; for the fountain is not now sealed any longer,
but open through the tender mercies of our God, for every thirsty soul;
that whosoever hath a will kindled in him by the
Lord may come to drink of the water of life freely.

Oh! drink then no longer at the muddy streams of your own conceivings and imaginations,
with which, that which inwardly thirsts after the living God,
and his pure streams of life, cannot be satisfied (it is not the true seed,
it is another birth which is satisfied with these things,
before the fountain of life comes to be opened in the heart); but wait on the Lord,
retire in spirit to be gathered into his light which he causes to shine in the heart,
and into his Son`'s life and Spirit, which he manifesteth and revealeth there;
that ye may eat that which is good, and be satisfied with the fatness of his house,
and drink of the river of his pleasures.
For indeed, the Lord, in this his gospel day,
doth make to his children a feast of fat things, and of wines on the lees well refined,
on his holy mountain, even in the kingdom which cannot be shaken;
and the Beloved doth not only knock at the door of the heart, but comes in,
and sups with his, and they with him.

16th of Eighth Month, 1672

TO THOMAS AND ANN MUDD

DEAR FRIENDS,

Of whose love to me, I have been and am sensible, and to whom I bear true love.

When I was last at Rickmansworth, it was on my heart to visit you;
and while I was there with you,
true and living breathings did spring up in my heart to the Lord for you.
Since, I have often thought of you, and in my desires have wished well concerning you,
as concerning my own soul.

Your days here cannot be long;
and what ye sow here ye must reap when ye go out of this world.
Oh that ye may now so sow to the Spirit of God,
as that ye may then reap of him life everlasting!

Last first day, my wife had a letter of George Fox`'s sent her,
which I heard read that night.
In the reading of it, I had many thoughts respecting you,
and a desire that ye might sincerely and uprightly, without prejudice, peruse it;
which I sent unto you the next day for that end.
Now, this morning ye were upon my heart;
and two or three things rose up in me in reference to you, as very necessary for you,
that ye may be safe, and that it may go well with you forever.

One was, that ye keep steadfast in that holy testimony of truth,
which was given forth among us at the beginning.
For this truth is the same, and the testimony of it doth not vary or pass away,
but shall last throughout ages and generations, to redeem all that receive it,
and are faithful to it.
The testimony was, to draw from outward, dead knowledge,
and out of dead practices and worships after men`'s own conceivings,
into an inward principle, and into worship in Spirit and truth,
both inwardly in the heart, and outwardly in the assemblies of God`'s gathering.

The second was, that ye keep in the sense, esteem,
and sanctified use of those holy instruments which God hath made choice of,
both to gather and build up his called and chosen ones.
It was never well with Israel,
when they slighted Moses (though they many times had exceptions against him),
nor when they despised the prophets,
whom God sent afterwards (though they were often prejudiced against them also);
nor was it well with any of the churches, when,
by the subtlety and seeming simplicity of those that endeavored to betray them,
or by any other means,
they were drawn to think meanly of any of the apostles or ministers of Christ,
in their day.
And the Lord, who preserved Moses in his day, and the prophets in their day,
and the apostles and holy ministers of truth in the first promulgation of the gospel,
is the same God still;
and doth and will preserve those whom he hath in
this age sent forth to publish his everlasting gospel,
and to gather his lambs and scattered sheep into holy gatherings and assemblies.

The third was, that ye be daily exercised, guided, and your hearts opened and quickened,
by the principle and Spirit of truth; that so ye may know what it is,
to walk with the Lord, and to feel the power of the Lord,
and enjoy the presence of the Lord; and be led by him out of, and away from,
the mysterious workings of the power and spirit of darkness inwardly.
For if, through grievous mistake, ye let this into your minds and spirits,
instead of the Spirit of truth, ye must needs call darkness light, and light darkness;
truth error, and error truth; and so will err from that which is indeed the way,
into somewhat which, in God`'s sight, is not so.
For there is a spirit of delusion as well as of truth;
this works in the heart as a minister of righteousness, in a seeming light,
and warming the heart with a wrong fire, brings it into a wrong bed of rest,
and administers to it a wrong peace, hope, and joy; setting up there a wrong sense,
belief, and judgment concerning itself and others.
This leads to separate from them that are true, and joins to them that are false;
draws from the assemblies and worships of God`'s gathering,
and begets prejudices against, and hard thoughts of, those who are owned by the Lord,
and are kept in their habitation by him, who dwells in them, and they in him.

O my friends! the Lord give you the true discerning of this spirit,
and of his own Spirit; and deliver you out of the snare of the enemy,
and open that eye in you, to which he gives the sight of what is, and who are, of him,
and what is, and who are, not of him:
that ye may be disjoined from all that is not of God, and joined to the Lord,
abiding and walking in him; and may know, that God doth not cast off his holy people,
gatherings, and assemblies,
but constantly appears in the midst of such as truly and humbly wait for him;
glory be to his name!

God knoweth in what sense, in what understanding, in what love, in what desire,
in what fear, in what knowledge, from him, I write this to you;
who am a true friend to you both (in true and faithful love, as in God`'s sight),
and a hearty desirer of your everlasting happiness.

19th of the Twelfth Month, 1672

TO COLONEL KENRICK

THE gospel dispensation consists in Spirit and power.
The kingdom which Christ and his apostles preached--which
the true believers were to receive,
and to wait for an entrance to be ministered to them into--stood not in word,
but in power.
Now there are four sorts of professors of the Christian religion in this our day,
one sort whereof only, are acquainted with the gospel dispensation.

First, There is one sort,
which have been nurtured in a profession of Christianity by education,
and have improved it by study, but have never known the power, virtue,
and inward life thereof; but as men, with the man`'s part, wisdom, understanding,
and seriousness of mind,
have considered of the truth and weight of things contained in the Scriptures,
and so have received somewhat of the holy doctrine into their natural understanding,
and given themselves up to the observation and practice thereof,
according as they have apprehended and understood things.
These have become more serious and excellent men than others,
but fall very far short of the nature and state of Christianity; yea,
the strictest among these, many times,
become the greatest opposers and persecutors of true Christianity.

Secondly, There are some who have had a taste of the true power,
and have had living desires and breathings after it,
and a sense of the preciousness and excellency of it;
who have also felt the quickening Spirit, and begun therein;
and yet have afterwards lost that sense,
and centred in a literal knowledge and wisdom about those very things,
which they had once some living experience of.
These are like salt which hath lost its savor;
and it is hard for them ever to be seasoned again;
and from among these do rise the greatest persecutors
and bitterest persecution against the life,
truth, and power.

Thirdly, There are some, who,
though they never came to the distinct knowledge of the power,
yet have had a great sense of their want of it, and have abode in that sense;
and in all the ways and forms of religion they have been or are in, still seek after it;
and reckon no form any thing, but as the power in some measure appears in it;
and the cry of their souls is daily after it, and their waiting is for it.
These, wherever they are, are of the true seed;
these are the birth of the heavenly Spirit and wisdom;
these are sheep of the true Shepherd`'s fold,
though not yet gathered home to the fold to which they properly belong.
These are the broken, the bruised, the sick, the wounded, the captives, the distressed,
the poor, the naked, etc., to whom the gospel of peace, the gathering, the salvation,
and redemption belongs.
And the bleating of these is known; yea,
their longing and cry after the redeeming and gathering power of the Shepherd is felt,
however they may be, at present, prejudiced against that very dispensation of truth,
life, and power, whereby the Shepherd gathers.

Fourthly,
There are some whom God hath brought to the distinct sense and knowledge of the power.
There are some whose minds God hath turned to the inward light and power.
There are some whom the Shepherd hath gathered home to the Father`'s house,
where is bread enough, and to the true fold,
where is rest and peace enough--some who have seen an end of all perfection,
in the legal comprehendings and creaturely strivings after life, righteousness,
and holiness, and are come to the commandment which is exceeding broad,
and wherein is life everlasting.
Now these experience somewhat of the gospel dispensation,
and know the difference between being under the law and under grace;
and can tell what the kingdom is which Christ preached and bade men seek,
and what the gospel is which the poor in spirit receive;
and what the healing is which drops from under the wing of the Saviour and Redeemer.
And they can tell what justification is, and what sanctification, regeneration,
and redemption is; and can distinguish between truth as testified in the letter,
and as it is in Jesus; between the law of the letter, and the law of the Spirit,
which is written in the new heart and mind,
by the finger of God`'s pure and living power.
Now the knowledge of these, the faith of these, the peace, the joy, the justification,
and sanctification, and redemption of these, differs greatly from all the former;
from the two first sorts in nature and kind, from the latter in degree, clearness,
and purity.
For though all the sheep of the true Shepherd have somewhat of the true knowledge,
somewhat of the true faith, somewhat of the true justification,
somewhat of the true sanctification,
and may at times have some taste of true peace and joy,
and have true breathings and supplications in their
spirits towards their Father that begat them;
yet, they are not clear, they are not pure, they are not unmixed;
there is a great deal which is not true, which passeth for true with them;
because they are not come to the anointing, to the eye-salve which opens the eye,
nor to the Spirit of judgment and burning, which separates inwardly in the heart,
understanding, mind, and judgment, between the precious and the vile.
So that when they speak of the heavenly things, they do but stutter and stammer;
and though truth can sometimes own their sense, yet, many times, not their words;
there is such a mixture of the dark, earthly comprehension in them,
which they are not delivered and redeemed from.
But it is otherwise with those who are turned to
the light and power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and have known it, and been exercised, fanned, and purged by it; for in them,
the blind eye is opened, the deaf ear unstopped; and to them,
the pure understanding and language is given, whereby they know and understand,
not only words concerning Him, but Him himself who is true, and are in him that is true,
even in Him who is the very God and life eternal.

Yet there are different states among those who are
thus effectually called and gathered home,
according to their growth in the truth, and faithfulness to it.
For if there be not a great care and watchfulness,
there may be a neglecting to hear the voice of the Shepherd, and to walk with him;
and then, such miss of the pastures of life, and of the pure rest, joy, and peace,
which he administers to others; and of the garment or covering of the Spirit,
which they who live and walk in the Spirit (in everything giving up to the Spirit,
and denying all the lusts and fruits of the flesh), daily find themselves covered with.
Nor doth God so "`dwell in them and walk in them,`" as he doth in those that remain separate
from all evil (from which the Spirit of judgment and burning purifies and separates),
and touch no unclean thing.
Yea, they who grieve Christ`'s Spirit, and do not heed his call and knocks,
he doth not so sup with them, nor they with him;
nor do such partake so of the river of life and wine of the kingdom,
as those whose ear is open to him,
and who are always ready to obey and follow him "`whithersoever he goeth.`"

TO WIDOW HEMMINGS

DEAR FRIEND,

I think it long since I heard from thee.
I remember the sweet and precious savor that was upon thy spirit,
the last time I was with thee, with my dear friend, J.C. It hath been my hope and desire,
that the Lord might preserve thee therein.

The truth in the inward parts is of God; that is the thing which all are to mind;
and in which, acceptance with God is witnessed.
Out of the truth in the inward parts, there is no acceptance with God,
let men profess what they will or can.
In the truth, there is always acceptance; for God never disowned it,
nor any that are in it.
Here, the flesh and blood which give life are fed on; here,
the bread which comes down from heaven and the water of life are known: but out of this,
they are not, nor can they be, known.

Oh, my friend, that thou mightest feel more and more the truth in the inward parts,
and be more and more established therein!
What is the feeding outward, or supper outward?
It is but a shadow.
The feeding inward, or the supper inward, is the substance.
And as the day dawns, and the day-star arises in thy heart, the shadows will flee away,
and the substance be discovered, owned, and delighted in by thee.
The shadows reach but to the outward part, but the ministration of life,
the ministration of the substance, reaches to the seed:
and thou must be more and more transplanted into the seed,
that Christ may be formed in thee, and thou formed in him;
and so grow up into his heavenly nature and image,--out of the earthly,
out of the natural.
Oh! the Lord God prosper his own seed and holy plantation in thy heart;
and keep thee in the meek, lowly, humble, poor, and tender spirit,
unto which is his mercy and blessing.

I expected to have heard from thee, or at least from thy daughter S., before this time,
supposing I had a promise thereof from her.
The Lord uphold, preserve, and bless her.
Let her not look out, but only look within, what the will of the Lord is;
and mind nothing else; and it will be well with her.

My dear love is both to thee and her, who am thy sincere friend,

I+++.+++ P.

4th of Ninth Month, 1673

TO +++_______+++ +++_______+++

DEAR FRIEND,--

For in those true desires, which I observe in thy heart towards the Lord, thou art,
and canst not but be,
dear unto me--I had a desire to have stayed a little while with thee,
the last time I passed through Uxbridge, but was prevented.

The occasion of my writing to thee was somewhat which was on my heart toward thee.

Wouldst thou know the Lord in the gospel covenant, and wouldst thou walk with him therein?
I know thou wouldst.
Wouldst thou have sin destroyed in thee, and Christ reign in thy heart?
Wouldst thou so fight against thy enemies, as to overcome, and so run the race,
as certainly to obtain the everlasting prize, and eternal weight of glory?
Oh! then, mind truth in the inward parts,
even the grace and truth which are by Jesus Christ; to whom God hath given power,
and who gives power to his, by the grace of his Holy Spirit,
over sin and corruption in the inward parts.
Did not God conquer the enemies of the outward Jews in Egypt, in the wilderness,
and in the good land also?
And shall he not do so inwardly, for the inward Jews?
There are enemies in Egypt; in the land that is, as I may say, wholly dark,
and under the oppression of Spiritual Pharaoh.
There are enemies in that heart, which is as a wilderness and solitary place;
and there are enemies in that heart, which is in some measure renewed,
and made good and honest.
Now all the spiritual enemies, all the enemies of a man`'s own house,
are to be destroyed by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ,
working by his grace in the heart; which being received, subjected to, dwelt in,
and obeyed, brings deliverance and salvation from them all.
And when salvation is brought home to the heart, and wrought out there by the Lord,
it is to be enjoyed and abode in,
and the soul is not to return back again into captivity;
but being delivered out of the hands of its inward and spiritual enemies, by the holy,
inward, and spiritual covenant, is to serve God in the dominion of his Son`'s life,
in holiness and righteousness all its days here upon the earth.

O my friend! mind this precious truth inwardly, this precious grace inwardly,
the precious life inwardly, the precious light inwardly, the precious power inwardly,
the inward word of life, the inward voice of the Shepherd in the heart, the inward seed,
the inward salt, the inward leaven, the inward pearl, etc., whereby Christ effects this.
Distinguish between words without concerning the thing, and the thing itself within;
and wait and labor, then to know, understand, and be guided by, the motives, leadings,
drawings, teachings, quickenings, etc., of the thing itself within.
And take heed of being offended, because of any thing, either within or without;
for offences will come, but blessed was he,
that was not offended at Christ outwardly in the days of his flesh; and blessed is he,
that is not offended at his inward truth,
and inward way of appearance in the day of his Spirit.
Moses, that precious servant of the Lord, spake unadvisedly with his lips;
how easy is it then, for those who come not near Moses`' state so to do; but wait on God,
that thou mayst distinguish between what truth speaks in any of us;
and what any of us may unadvisedly speak,
out of the truth,--if we stand not upon the watch,
and our words be not seasoned with God`'s light and his grace.
For praying to God, as God`'s Spirit leads and gives ability, and watching unto prayer,
and seeking opportunities both alone and in our families, that God may open our hearts,
and breathe upon us,
and for frequent and diligent reading of the Holy Scriptures,--none
can testify from the truth against these things;
though against men`'s dead and formal performing of these things,
there is a living testimony.
Now take heed of mistaking the testimony in any; or of being stumbled,
if any go beyond their due bounds in their testimony.

O my friend, how precious is the thing, beyond all words or testimonies!
Oh that thou mayst come to know that in thyself,
and to be sensible of God`'s ministering by it to thee,
and increasing it in thee! that thou mayst experimentally feel the seed in thee,
and find it grow more and more, till it come to be a tree; and then sit under its shadow,
and be delighted with its defence, and partake of its sap and fruit.
Oh that every day thou mightest have a sense of the life itself, the truth itself,
the power itself, the wisdom itself,
the righteousness itself! and that thou mightest find the
Lord Jesus Christ both unclothing and clothing thee inwardly,
sensibly, and experimentally;--that thou mightest find him taking away thy sin,
thy iniquities, thy unrighteousness, both within and without also, and filling thee,
and clothing thee with his righteousness;--that so, in God`'s sight,
and by his putting on thee, and forming in thee,
thou mightst find thy heart filled and covered with the nature,
image and Spirit of his dear Son;--that thou mightest indeed,
put off the old man with his nature and deeds, and put on the new man,
and know the renewing and new-creating in Christ Jesus,
in the spirit of thy mind;--and so have a certain understanding of the truth,
as it is in Jesus, and as he manifests it, gives power to it,
and causes it to work in thy heart.
This is the desire of my soul for thee: the Lord guide thee to it,
and remove all lets and hindrances out of thy way.

My dear and true love is to thy husband.
The Lord manifest his pure and living truth in both your hearts,
and gather both your minds thereunto, and make you one therein.

Thy friend in truth, who heartily wisheth well to thy soul.

Grove Place, 17th of Ninth Month, 1673

TO ELIZABETH STONAR

DEAR FRIEND,

Whose life in the Lord, and prosperity in the truth, my heart greatly desireth;
even that thou mayst come to the perfect service,
and free and full enjoyment of thy soul`'s Beloved; in which,
if I could be in any way helpful to thee,
my heart would greatly rejoice and bless the Lord.
This morning, when I awoke, my heart was exercised before the Lord concerning thee;
and several things did spring up in my mind relating to thee,
which I may now signify to thee, as the Lord shall please to bring them again to my mind,
and open them in my heart in reference to thee.
I would fain have thee rightly understand, and be found doing,
what the Lord requires of thee; that it may go well with thee,
and that thy heart may be satisfied, and thy soul blessed,
in believing and obeying the truth as it is in Jesus.

The first thing that rose up in my heart concerning thee this morning was,
about confessing Christ before men.
It is a great duty, and I would not have thee mistake about it or fail in it;
but diligently wait on God to know what it is,
and faithfully to practise it in thy state and place; which if thou do,
thou wilt find life and blessedness flowing with it upon thy soul.

After this, several scriptures, sweet and precious to my taste,
sprang up in my heart to lay before thy view; that thou also mightest suck sweetness,
and reap benefit through the living sense of them,
and the bowing of thy spirit to what the Lord shall
please to make manifest to thee thereby.

The first scripture that sprang up in me to thee,
was that of Rom. 12:2. not to be conformed to this world,
but to be transformed by the renewing of thy mind, that thou mayst prove that good,
that acceptable and perfect will of God.
Thou must stand at a distance from the spirit of this world,
thou must not touch the unclean thing, but be a chaste virgin in heart, in word,
in conversation, if thou expect to be married to the Lamb, to become one spirit with him,
to know his mind, and to enjoy the love and be the delight of his Father.

The next scripture in my heart was, Rev. 2:10.
"`Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer.`"
Upon which scripture this question rose in my heart to thee,
Dost not thou fear the sufferings which may attend thee, in thy state and place,
for truth`'s sake?
Dost not thou look out at them?
If thou do, it will weaken thy faith, and be a snare to thee; and such a beam in thy eye,
that thou wilt never be able to see that particular way and path of truth,
which is most proper for thy soul, till this beam be plucked out and separated from thee.

Unto this was soon added that of Isaiah 51:12-13. "`I, even I,
am he that comforteth you: who art thou,
that thou shouldst be afraid of a man that shall die,
and of the son of man which shall be made as grass; and forgettest the Lord thy Maker,
that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth;
and hast feared continually every day, because of the fury of the oppressor,
as if he were ready to destroy?
and where is the fury of the oppressor?`" Oh, take heed of distrusting the Comforter,
thy Comforter! who is able and ready to help and comfort the souls of his,
in the sorest distresses and oppressions that can befall them, either within or without.
And consider this also,
that forgetting the Lord is the necessary consequence of fearing man.
It cannot be,
but that he that feareth man should in some measure or degree forget the Lord,--his love,
his wisdom, his power, his goodness, his faithfulness to,
and tender care over his children in their following him,--especially in the
midst of the cruel hardships and sufferings which often befall them therein.

The next was Samson`'s riddle: Judges 14:14. "`Out of the eater came forth meat,
and out of the strong came forth sweetness.`" It is everlastingly true,
both inwardly and outwardly, to the children of the Most High, who live in his Spirit,
and walk in his Spirit, and are guided by the power and virtue of his life.
Everything that would devour and destroy them the Lord destroyeth,
by the power and virtue of his life and Spirit springing up in them;
and out of that which is strong against them,
which roars against them in the strength and power of darkness,
the Lord brings forth sweetness in and to their spirits.

Then that of Luke 9:23-24. came before me (which is said
to all that hear Christ`'s voice and blessed counsel):
"`If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily,
and follow me.
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it;
but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.`" Now,
I beseech thee, consider; dost thou take up the daily cross,
and bear it faithfully for Christ`'s sake?
Dost thou stand a faithful witness against the spirit of darkness, and works of darkness,
where thou livest?
Dost thou not comply with any worship there which thy heart
knoweth to be out of the truth and Spirit of life,
wherein all true, holy, living, spiritual worship can alone be performed?
Oh! take heed of shunning the cross in any respect; for then thou givest way to unbelief,
and to that wisdom, thoughts, reasonings, and judgment which are not of the truth,
but of the flesh: shunning that which God hath appointed to crucify sin in the heart,
and under which the seed is to spring up and live,
which is the power of God unto salvation, to all that abide under it, and daily bear it.

The last scripture, which at this time sprang up in me to thee,
was that very sweet one in Solomon`'s Song of Songs: chap.
1 ver. 7-8. "`Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest,
where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon:
for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
If thou know not, O thou fairest among women,
go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock,
and feed thy kids beside the shepherds`' tents.`" If
thou wouldst come to the feeding-place of the flock,
and to rest in the pure life, power, and righteousness of the Lord with them;
thou must mind their footsteps,
thou must go forth out of that which God hath gathered and led them forth out of,
thou must forsake whatever is not of the Father, but of this world (and in forsaking it,
stand a witness against the world), as God hath taught them to forsake it.
Thou must wait for the same Spirit, for the same cloud and smoke by day,
and the shining of the same flaming fire by night, to lead thee and preserve thee,
which hath led and preserved them.
See Isa. 4:5. And this will lead thee out of the same Egypt and Sodom,
and all the remainders of Babylon, wherein as yet thou mayst be held captive;
and this alone must break the oppressing spirit and power which stands in thy way,
through thy faithful sufferings under it.
And through the same wilderness and righteous judgments of the Lord, thou must pass,
that they have passed.
For Zion and her converts must be redeemed with judgment and righteousness,
and with the Spirit of burning, and the pain of the cross; nor dost thou know,
how thou standest in the way of thy own soul`'s good,
while thou in any measure avoidest or escapest it.
And if thou be one of the called, chosen, and faithful, following fully after the Lord,
in the same Spirit, and power, and banner of the cross, under which his called, chosen,
and faithful ones have followed him; he will lead thee into the same land of life, rest,
and peace, and holy dominion over sin and Satan, into which he hath led those,
who have faithfully followed the Lamb, whithersoever he hath pleased to go before,
and lead them.
So thou must wait to have thy heart daily more and more opened,
and guided purely and livingly and sensibly by the Lord,
into what he hath led his children, servants, family, and redeemed heritage.
For of a truth, the Lord hath raised the seed of life in his people;
and what his seed denies, what the life of the Son denies,
what truth in the heart denies, all that are of the truth and in the truth,
will be taught by it, and learn of it, to deny also.

Thus, my dear friend, in the most dear, tender, and true love,
have I opened my heart to thee, as things sprang in me for thy sake:
and the desire of my soul to the Lord is, that they may be serviceable to thee,
and that thou mayest be led by the holy, leading Spirit more and more into truth,
and live in truth, and feel the life of truth living and reigning in thee;
being delivered from the enemy`'s temptations, and the subtle twinings of the serpent,
which thy condition will often meet with: the Lord discover them to thee,
and preserve thee from being ensnared with them.

Thy constant friend in the dear love and service of the truth.

My love to Friends at Chalfont, as if I named particulars.
I love them faithfully, and watch for their souls, and am in unity with the living body,
and in the tender sense and love of Truth.
Beseech them to take heed how they judge Friends in general, or the meeting,
or the meetings of Friends, who singly wait on the Lord,
to be guided by him in what they do.
Alas! they may easily apprehend that, in a particular case, Friends should do thus,
and thus; but perhaps they may not see or feel how solemnly Friends in that particular,
wait on the Lord to be guided by him;
and will they who see not how things went in such or such a particular case,
venture to judge the result of Friends?
This cannot but tend greatly to their hurt, if they be found in such a practise;
and they may lose their condition, and the sense of Truth in themselves,
and of their own states, and grow up and be strong in a contrary wisdom,
before they are aware.
O, how have I travailed for them,
and how faithfully have I spoken in the name of the Lord.
O, that the labour of my love towards them, may not be in vain to any of them.
If prejudice get up in any of them, against the meetings,
which they ought to think well of,
and whose judgment they ought to be subject to in the Lord;
that prejudice will become as a canker, and will eat out the good in their own hearts,
and they will not be justified in God`'s sight; when they, whom they condemn,
will be justified even in that very particular.
If they had been present at meetings, as I have been,
and had seen the deep retirement and watch, that hath been on our spirits,
and the weighty presence and power of the Lord,
which hath been manifested in the midst of us, they would be afraid,
to give themselves liberty hastily to speak against any thing that is done there.
We cannot answer the will of any, in any thing;
but our God must go before us in everything, or we must stop till he make our way clear.

TO WIDOW HEMMINGS

MY DEAR FRIEND,

I have not forgotten thee; but have often inquired after thee,
and many times breathed for thee.

O my friend! look not out at what stands in the way;
what if it look dreadfully as a lion,
is not the Lord stronger than the mountains of prey?
but look in, where the law of life is written, and the will of the Lord revealed,
that thou mayst know what is the Lord`'s will concerning thee;
and then show thyself a faithful daughter of Abraham, and be like Sarah,
not terrified with any amazement.
So soon as I had read thy letter, this arose in my heart to thee as God`'s counsel,
proper to thy state.
Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
Be not straitened in thy spirit, as fearing what thou shalt suffer for Christ`'s sake;
or as if God would not stand by thee, or carry thee through.
Be thy sufferings as great as possible, yet he is faithful,
who hath promised thee an hundred fold in this life.

Oh! what can hurt thee, if thy God stand by thee?
Be faithful to his testimony in thy place, and he will stand by thee.
Take heed of joining with dead worships, which the seed of God in thee disowns,
and cannot relish; but meekly and in fear,
testify against and abstain from what thou feelest not to be of the Lord.

This was what was in my heart to thee at present, in true and tender love,
and in melting desires for thee, that the Lord may guide and preserve thee,
and give thee of the Lamb`'s courage and strength,
who by meekness and sufferings is now to conquer.
What if the wicked nature, which is as a sea casting out mire and dirt, rage against thee!
There is a river, a sweet, still, flowing river,
the streams whereof will make glad thy heart.
And learn but in quietness and stillness to retire to the Lord, and wait upon him;
in whom thou shalt feel peace and joy,
in the midst of thy trouble from the cruel and vexatious spirit of this world.
So wait to know thy work and service to the Lord every day, in thy place and station;
and the Lord make thee faithful therein, and thou wilt want neither help, support,
nor comfort.

Thy friend, in the truest, sincerest, and most constant love.

TO CATHARINE PORDAGE

AH!
MY POOR, DISTRESSED, ENTANGLED FRIEND,

While thou seekest to avoid the snare, thou deeply runnest into it:
for thou art feeding on the tree of knowledge, in giving way to these thoughts,
reasonings and suggestions,
which keep thee from obedience to that which hath been made manifest to thy understanding.
And thou mayst well be feeble in thy mind,
while thou art thus separated from Him who is thy strength, and lettest in his enemy.
This is not the right feebleness of mind which God pities,
nor the right way of waiting to receive strength.
Why shouldst not thou act, so far as God gives thee light?
and why shouldst thou not appear willing to obey him, even in little things,
so far as he hath given thee light?
What if I should say,
that all this is but the subtlety of the serpent`'s wisdom to avoid the cross,
and is not that simplicity and plainness of heart towards God,
which thou takest it to be; and that thou art loath to be so poor, and low,
and mean in the eyes of others, as this practice would make thee appear?

And what a subtle device hath the enemy put into thy mind about prayer;
which hath no weight nor truth in it, as applied to this present case.
For prayer is the breath of life, an effect of God`'s spiritual breathing,
which no man can perform aright without the Spirit`'s breathing upon him.
Therefore the Spirit is to be waited upon, for his breathings and holy fire,
that the sacrifice may be living, and acceptable to the living God.
But this is language, as a man or woman in ordinary converse;
and doth not require a motion of life to bring it forth,
no more than to bring forth other words.
And wilt thou say, Thou longest and pantest after the Lord,
and the way of truth and righteousness; and yet remain walking,
against the light which God has given thee, in things of this nature?

O my friend, thou and thy husband have dallied too long.
The Lord hath shewn great love and mercy towards you.
Take heed of dallying any longer.
Make straight paths to your feet,
lest that which is crooked (your feet have hitherto been
too winding and crooked) be turned out of the way;
but it is the desire of my soul for you, that they may rather be rectified and healed.

Thou sayest, the seasons when thou findest it most laid upon thee,
is in the hearing of Friends, or soon after; and when, in that sense,
thou resolvest to enter upon the practice,
thou findest an inability to keep thee therein; though thy reason is not only silenced,
but in measure subjected thereunto.
Now do but mind how far the Lord hath gone with thee; and what hinders,
and whether it be thy duty to give way to, or to resist, that which hinders.
Thou dost confess God hath laid it upon thee;
and laid it upon thee at those times when thy heart is most tender
and open towards Him (even when thou art in the hearing of Friends,
or soon after); and hath brought thee into a resolution to enter into the practice; nay,
to help thee further, hath not only silenced thy reason, but subjected it in measure.
Have not many entered into the practice, and found acceptance and a blessing therein,
who never were thus helped?
What wouldst thou have of the Lord?
How far hath He proceeded towards bringing thee into obedience in this thing!
But thou sayest, thou findest an inability to keep therein.
Dost thou abide in the faith, where the strength is dispensed;
and out of the thoughts and consultations,
where the strength of the strongest (if they intermeddle there) is broken?
O! take heed to murmuring against the Lord (as thou hast been too apt to do):
and consider what great matter of complaint He hath against thee.
What could He have done more for thee, than He hath done?
thou being no more ready to meet Him than thou hast been; but, upon all occasions,
turning aside from his convictions and drawings, into thine own thoughts and reasonings.

I received thy letter last night; and, upon reading of it,
was greatly burdened and grieved for thy sake;
feeling thy spirit so exceedingly wrong in this matter,
and thy reasonings and way therein so crooked and provoking to the Lord.
But this morning, my heart was opened and drawn forth in this manner to thee.
The Lord give a present and a future sight of the enemy`'s working,
against the working of the love of God towards thee,
and against the redemption and peace of thy soul.
My heart breatheth to the Lord for thee;
and desireth that He may manifest to thee that nature,
wisdom and spirit from whence these things arise,
and what is in thee which they prevail upon:
that the child may not always stick in the birth,
but at length be brought forth into the light, into the life,
into the faith which gives victory, and into the single-hearted and holy obedience,
where the pure power is met with.

Thy friend in the truth, and in sincere love,

Amersham, 25th of Ninth Month, 1675

TO MY DEAR SUFFERING FRIENDS IN SCOTLAND

DEAR FRIENDS AND BRETHREN,

Who have partaken of the tender mercy and blessed visitation of the Lord.

Oh, blessed be the Lord, who pitied and helped us in our low estate,
and whose tender love and mercy hath followed us, from his first visiting us,
to this present day!
And indeed, the Lord is with us, (what can we desire more?) preparing us for himself,
preserving us in the life of his blessed truth, building us up more and more,
and causing his Spirit of glory and living power to rest upon us,
and the virtue thereof to spring up in us day by day.

Oh, the beauty and glory of the day of our God increaseth upon his heritage,
blessed be the name of the Lord!
And to what tend all the workings of the contrary spirit and power,
but to eat out its own interest and kingdom,
through the Lord`'s blessed ordering of things;
so that all things work together for good, and for the advancing of truth,
and the growth of it in the hearts of God`'s heritage.

So, my dear friends, none look out, either at outward or inward sufferings;
but to the Lord only, whose life, Spirit, and power is above them,
and bears up all over them, who are in spirit joined to him, faithfully waiting upon him;
which God daily teaches and enables his to do.
Thus, my dear friends, feel the Lord`'s presence and power among you,
who is always near his, but especially in the time of their straits, trials,
and sufferings: and wait to feel the life springing,
and doing its proper work in each of you day by day;
working out what is to be wrought out in any,
and working more and more into the glory of the heavenly image;
that through the sufferings, ye may come into the glory, and be crowned with the glory,
virtue, holiness, righteousness, and dominion of life over all;
and thus the Son may sit upon his throne in you,
and wield his holy and righteous sceptre, and give you dominion in and with him,
over all that would veil life, or keep it under, in any of you.
So, my dear friends, be strong in the Lord, with the strength of the Lord,
with which he is clothing those whom he hath emptied and made weak; for the trials,
temptations, and afflictions prepare for, and (as I may say) lead into the possession of,
the desired inheritance;
where all that the soul hath breathed and waited for is bestowed upon it,
by the bountiful hand of the Father of mercies, who keeps covenant and mercy forever,
and renews covenant and mercy day by day.

So the tender God of my life,
and Father of the blessings and mercies of my once greatly distressed and miserable soul,
instruct you, preserve you, watch over you; exercise your spirits most advantageously,
daily open you to himself;
keep you empty and naked before him of all your own clothing and righteousness,
and fill you with that which flows from the pure, living fountain;
to the unspeakable joy of your hearts, and the glory of his own name over all forever.

Be of good faith, my dear friends, look not out at any thing;
fear none of those things ye may be exposed to suffer, either outwardly or inwardly;
but trust the Lord over all, and your life will spring, and grow, and refresh you,
and the love and power will purge out, and keep out, what would hinder its growth;
and ye will learn obedience and faithfulness more and more,
even by your exercises and sufferings; yea,
the Lord will teach you the very mystery of faith and obedience;
(oh blessed lesson!) and ye shall not be disappointed of your hope or crown,
by any thing the enemy can plot or bring about against you,
but have the weight of glory increased and enlarged
by his temptations and your many sufferings;
the wisdom, power, love, and goodness of the Lord, ordering everything for you,
and ordering your hearts in everything,--you having given up to him,
and keeping them continually given up to him, in the holy seed of truth,
in which he hath in some measure already joined, and is daily more and more joining,
you to himself.

This is the salutation and tender visit of the love of your brother in the truth;
whose breathings are to God for you, and his praises unto him,
through the sense of his being with you, and daily showing mercy to you,
upholding and preserving you in the midst of your sore trials and afflictions.

TO HIS BROTHER ARTHUR

DEAR BROTHER,

I have been a traveller after the Lord from my childhood,
and great misery have I undergone for want of him.
That which I wanted was his Spirit, life, virtue,
and redeeming power to be revealed in my own heart.
Oh, blessed be the Lord! beyond my expectation,
he hath directed me where to wait for this within, and hath revealed it in me;
and now I can say in truth of heart,
and in the sense of that birth which God hath begotten in me,
"`Lo! this is my God whom I so wanted and waited for;`" and
I find him stronger in my heart than the strong man,
which possessed it before he cast him out from thence, and made a spoil of his goods.
And now, dear brother, how can I hold my peace, and not testify of the love, mercy,
and good-will of the Lord towards me, and invite others to the redeeming power,
of which the Lord in his goodness hath made me a partaker?
And now, brother, a few words respecting thy return to what I sent thee;
not for contention`'s sake (the Lord knows my dwelling
is in that life and peace which shuts them out),
but in the tender love and care of my heart concerning the eternal welfare of thy soul,
which I would not, by any means or device of the enemy, have eternally deceived.

All sides may agree in notions about the regenerating power;
but all do not receive the regenerating power,
nor are truly regenerating in the sight of God;
nor come to witness the head of the serpent inwardly crushed, and his works destroyed,
and kingdom laid waste inwardly by this power; which must needs be,
before a man be translated out of the kingdom of darkness,
into the kingdom of the dear Son.
There is a kingdom of darkness inwardly,
which the unbelieving and disobedient to God`'s Spirit and power dwell in;
and there is a kingdom of light inwardly, wherein the children of light dwell with God,
and walk in the light as he is in the light.

But that the work of regeneration is only begun in this life,
and not finished till the other life, that is a great mistake.
For the Scriptures testify, that salvation is to be wrought out here, and not hereafter.
Christ had all power in heaven and earth,
and he sent forth his Spirit and power to work out the work here;
and his sanctifying Spirit and power is able to sanctify throughout, in soul, body,
and spirit; and the gifts of the ministry are for perfecting the saints,
till they all come in the unity of the faith, unto a perfect man,
that they may be presented to God perfect in Christ Jesus.
The holy leaven is put into the lump here, and it is able to leaven the lump here;
and holiness is not only to be begun, but perfected in the fear of God,
as the apostle exhorts, who did not exhort to a needless or impossible thing;
and the whole armor of God is able to defend the
whole man from all the assaults of the wicked one;
for greater is He, in the saints, that preserves from sin, than he that tempts to sin.
Oh, how precious is it to war with the enemy in this conquering faith,
and to resist him therein! that he may still flee away,
for fear of God`'s power and sword, which will pierce him and can easily overcome him.

There is a state where the spirit is willing, but the flesh weak:
yet it is not so where the spirit is become strong in the Lord,
and in the power of his might.
There is a holy hill of God, a spiritual Zion, a mountain whereupon his house is built,
which the wing of the Almighty overshadows;
and his sheep that are gathered by the great Shepherd and Bishop of the soul feed there,
and none can make afraid.
The flesh will be rebelling against the Spirit,
until it be destroyed by the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
But when a man is really crucified with Christ, and dead to sin,
sin hath no more power over him;
for Christ lives in him and reigns in his heart over sin and the temptations thereof.
When the God of peace treads Satan under the feet
of the soul that was once captived by him,
there it is known whose the kingdom and the power and the victory and the dominion is.

And this is true blessedness begun, carried on, and upheld by the pure,
sanctifying power of the word of life in the heart; and the birth which is born of God,
knows it to be no delusion, but the truth as it is in Jesus.
And such are obedient to the holy church of God, and to the holy ministry,
which he hath brought out of the wilderness;
and know of what nature the churches and ministry have been,
which have appeared and been set up in the world,
since the true church fled into and was hid in the wilderness,
and was fed there by the Lord God of life.
The devil hath long transformed himself into the likeness of an angel of light,
and cheated and beguiled souls; while the false church hath reigned,
antichrist sitting in the temple, the man-child having been caught up to God,
and the true church in the wilderness; and men have generally put darkness for light,
and light for darkness.
But blessed be the Lord! the true light, which shone in the apostles`' days,
now shines again; and discovers the mystery of iniquity,
and the golden cup of abominations, wherewith the earth hath been made drunk;
and Satan falls down like lightning before the power of Him,
on whom the true church leaned, when she came out of the wilderness, and still leans,
and will lean upon forever;
and the gates of hell shall not be able to prevail against her.

And blessed be the Lord! who hath brought many wanderers
and distressed ones to the sight of the true church,
and to delightful obedience to her, whose voice is not different to Christ`'s,
but one with it; and such are in fellowship with the Father and Son,
and with the saints who dwell in the light.
These are clothed with the Lamb`'s innocency and righteousness,
and do not dwell in darkness nor in sin;
having crucified the old man with his affections and lusts,
and put off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,
and put on the new man which is created in Christ Jesus,
in the righteousness and holiness of truth.
They that are here dwell not in fancies, nor feed on fancies, but on eternal life,
in the pure pastures of life,
where the Shepherd of the inward and spiritual Israel feeds his holy flock day by day.

As for the Romish church,
or any other church built up in the apostasy from the spirit and life of the apostles,
the Lord hath given me to see through them, to that which was before them,
and will be after them.
And O dear brother! if thou couldst but rightly wait for and meet with the holy,
regenerating, purifying power, which in tender love I testified to thee of;
it would lead thee to that which is the true church indeed,
which hath been persecuted by the dragon and false church,
and the blood of her seed made drunk by the bloody, dragonish church, for many ages.

The Lord hath made me thy brother in the line of nature;
oh that thou wert my brother in that truth, which lives and abides forever!
Oh that thou knew the church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven,
the Jerusalem which is above, which is free,
which is the mother of all who are born of the regenerating virtue and power!

20th of Seventh Month, 1676

TO SIR WILLIAM ARMORER (so styled)

FRIEND,

The weighty sense of an eternal condition after this life,
hath been upon my heart from my childhood; and it is often with me,
that I must give an account to God, when I pass out of this transitory world,
of all things done in the body; and shall enter into eternal rest and blessedness,
or eternal woe or misery.

This causeth me to call upon the Lord daily, for grace and wisdom from him;
that my conscience, being cleansed through the blood of his Son,
may be kept void of offence, both towards him and men.
And truly (I speak not boastingly, but in the fear of the Lord,
and in the sense of his goodness and tender mercy to me),
my heart is preserved in love and innocency towards those, who most injuriously,
and without provocation on my part, have taken away my liberty, for aught I know,
for my whole lifetime.
What thou further intendest towards me, the Lord knows,
to whom I have committed my cause: but this is on my heart to express to thee, because,
when I was with thee, thou spakest words to this purpose, that we wished thee hanged,
or would be glad if thou wert hanged.
God, who knows my heart, is witness, that I wish thee no evil,
neither to thee nor thy family; but wish thou mayst avoid all such things,
as may bring his wrath and curse upon thee, either in this world or the world to come.

And, friend, do not provoke the Lord by afflicting those that fear him;
but cease to do evil, learn to do well; and this will please the Lord,
and is more acceptable to him than all the worship
that can be offered up to him without this.

I have sent thee a little book, as a token of my love,
desiring thee to peruse it seriously.
Oh! do not endeavor to bring me into such a condition as is there related.
I have had greater light, in the way into which the Lord hath led me, than this man had;
and in that light I have seen, that I ought not to swear,
but to give the "`Yea`" and "`Nay`" of truth, which comes from the Christian nature,
and is of far more certainty and assurance than swearing.
For the man that swears may easily break his oath,
but he that keeps to the truth cannot alter his yea and nay, but it stands in the truth;
and this our Lord and Master hath set above, and on the top of, and instead of, swearing;
which if we should vary from and deny,
we should deny him who hath taught us not to swear.
Indeed, if we had not learnt it of the Lord, and if it was not by him required of us,
we should rather swear than otherwise; for we would very willingly give men satisfaction,
in those particulars which they require us to swear about.

Friend, God hath given thee an immortal soul,
and doth require of thee righteousness towards thy fellow creatures,
and temperance and moderation of spirit,
and sensibleness of the judgment to come after this life.
Thou are stricken in years, and thou hast but a little moment left remaining of thy time;
and then it will be determined concerning thy soul, what or how it shall be forever!
Let the words of love, truth, and innocency from me, prevail upon thee to be serious,
and to let in the sense and fear of God upon thy heart.
Thou hast spent much time in serving man; Oh, spend a little in serving and fearing God!
There is somewhat, which is pure, of God,
appointed by him to exercise the conscience towards him.
Thou hast such a thing near thee.
Oh that thou mightest know it, and be joined to it! for till then,
thou canst never truly serve nor fear the Lord,
but mayst spend thy time here in a vain show,
and at last be judged and condemned by the Lord, and lie down in eternal sorrow; which,
it is the desire of my heart, may not be thy portion from the hand of the Lord.

This is from a sufferer by thee,
who never gave thee the least cause or provocation so to deal with me.

I+++.+++ P.

TO THE LADY CONWAY

DEAR FRIEND,

I have heard both of thy love to truth, and of thy great afflictions outwardly;
both which occasion a sense concerning thee,
and breathings to the tender Father of my life for thee;
that thy heart may know and be joined to the truth, and thou mayst live and walk in it,
reaping the sweet comfort, support and satisfaction,
which God daily ministers in and through it, to his gathered and preserved ones.
I am satisfied thou hast need of comforts and support; oh that thou mayst be led thither,
and be daily found by the Lord there,
where the Comforter doth daily delight to supply the afflicted and suffering ones,
whether inwardly or outwardly, with comfort.

And, my dear friend, take heed of that wisdom and knowledge which is not of the seed,
and which can be held in the mind, without the springing life of the seed.
The first day I was convinced,
I was not only convinced in my understanding concerning the seed,
but I felt the seed in my heart,
and my heart was enraptured with the sense and feeling of it;
and my great cry to the Lord was,
that I might faithfully travel through all the sufferings and death of the other part,
into union with an enjoyment of it; and that that wisdom,
which was not of the pure living root and nature, might die in me.
Now, how I have been exercised and taught since is hard for me to utter.
What poverty, what weakness, what foolishness I have been led into! how I have learned,
in a sense, out of the reach of the comprehending, knowing mind;
how tender I have been of every secret shining of light in my heart;
how the Lord hath taught and enabled me to pluck out my right eye,
and cut off my right hand, and cast them from me, that I might not see with that eye,
nor work with that hand, but be greatly maimed in the sight of men,
and in my own sight too.

O friend! wait daily to feel the seed, to feel the seed live in thee,
and the most pleasing part of thy nature die, as it can live out of the seed.
Oh that thou couldst change all old knowledge, for that which is new and living!
The seed is the well: receive the seed, then thou receivest the well: let it spring,
wait for its springing, wait to know its springing: bear all the trials and judgments,
which the Father of life sees necessary to prepare the heart for its springing.
Oh, feel that which limits and subdues thoughts,
and brings them into captivity and subjection!
Be not exercised in things too high for thee--David, the man after God`'s own heart,
who was wiser than his teachers, was not;--but come out of knowledge into feeling,
and there thou wilt find the true knowledge given,--arising, springing,
and covering thy heart, as the waters cover the sea.
And still wait to be taught of God,
to distinguish between the outwardness of knowledge--the
notional part of the thing known,
as it can be comprehended in the mind,--and the life of it,
as it is felt and abides in the heart.

The Lord God of my life be thy Teacher; point thy mind to the pure seed of the kingdom,
and open it in thee; make thee so little, that thou mayst enter into it,
and keep thee so low and poor, that thou mayst abide in it;
managing these troublesome times in the outward, for thy advantage in the inward;
that the city and temple of the living God may be built in it,
and thou mayst know him daily dwelling and walking therein.
Thus mayst thou be married to the Lord, and become one spirit with him;
finding that daily removing from thee, +++[+++which is to be removed, even]
by the mighty arm and pure operation of his Spirit,
till all that is contrary be done away;
then may thy soul dwell with its Beloved in fulness of joy, life, and peace forevermore.

This is from the tender love, and fresh breathings of life, in thy soul`'s true Friend,
and most hearty well-wisher,

I+++.+++ P.

17th of Third Month, 1677

TO JAMES EELES

FRIEND,

God is my witness, to whom I must give an account of all my actions,
that it is my desire to be found in all true love, courtesy, and righteousness,
in my dealings towards all men; and that I would by no means deny any man his just due,
which he can by any just law or right claim from me.

Now, as touching tithes, the payment or refusing of them is to me a matter of conscience,
weighty on my heart before the Lord; and I would do therein as he might justify,
and not condemn me.
I know tithes were ordained by God, to be paid to the Levitical priesthood,
under the law; but the same power that ordained them under the law,
disannulled them under the gospel.
Heb. 7:12 and 18. Here is God`'s power and authority for disannulling them.
Now, that any man or men have true right, power,
and authority to set up or require to be paid, under the gospel,
what God`'s power hath disannulled,--indeed, I do not see;
nor can I be subject to any human authority or law in this thing,
without sinning against God, and incurring his wrath upon my soul,
which I have formerly found very dreadful, and would not,
for fear of sufferings in this world, expose myself to the bearing of.
Besides, Christ saith, "`He that denies me before men,
him will I deny before my Father.`" He is the substance of all the figures under the law;
he hath put an end to them; he is King, Priest, and Prophet in the church of God;
all power in heaven and earth is given to him,
and he sent forth his ministers without tithes.
Now, tithes were set up in the dark time of popery, and not by the gospel light;
and they who know the gospel light dare not be subject
to that which was set up in matters of religion,
by the dark power of Rome, in the time of darkness.

I was willing to give thee this plain and naked account,
that thou mayst see how weighty the thing is with me,
and how dangerous it would be to me, to do what thou requirest of me; for in so doing,
I should lose my peace with God,
I should be unfaithful to the testimony he hath given me to bear,
I should dishonor his name and truth,
and bring his sore wrath and displeasure upon my soul and conscience.
Judge, thyself, in this matter,
whether I had not better expose myself to any outward sufferings,
though ever so great (either from thee or any thou shalt make use of),
than expose my soul to so great inward misery and sufferings,
for disobedience to the Lord in this particular.
Consider Ralph Trumper,^
footnote:[See Besse`'s Sufferings of Friends, Vol.
1st, p 78, 79.]
a just tender, honest-hearted man,--how much he hath suffered in this respect,
to keep his conscience clear in this thing; who, I believe,
would rather suffer all his former losses ten times over again,
than suffer what he did (to my knowledge), for paying tithes,
after he was convinced of the evil and unlawfulness of it.
I do not contend with thee by the law of the land;
but I must be subject to the law of God, who shows me from what root tithes came;
and that they are not the maintenance of the ministry of Christ, or allowed by Christ,
but the maintenance of the ministry Rome`'s power set up;
both which ministry and its maintenance are to be denied and witnessed against,
by those whom he calls forth to testify to his truth in these things.

So, at present, I say no more, but remain thy friend, ready to do thee any good,
though I should suffer ever so deeply from thee.

I+++.+++ P.

25th of Fourth Month, 1677

TO DULCIBELLA LAITON

DEAR FRIEND,

Concerning whom I feel a travail, this is the sense of my heart in relation to thee.

There is a pure seed of life which God hath sown in thee; oh that it might come through,
and come over all that is above it, and contrary to it!
And for that end wait daily to feel it, and to feel thy mind subdued by it,
and joined to it.
Take heed of looking out, in the reasonings of thy mind,
but dwell in the feeling sense of life; and then that will arise in thee more and more,
which maketh truly wise, and gives power,
and brings into the holy authority and dominion of life.
Many that have been long travelling,
are now entering into their possessions and inheritance,
which the Lord is daily enlarging in them, and to them.
Oh that thy lot may be among them, inwardly witnessed and possessed by thee!
Prize inward exercises, griefs, and troubles,
and let faith and patience have their perfect work in them.
Oh, desire to be good, upright, and perfect in God`'s sight! and wait to feel the life,
Spirit and power which makes so.
Come out of the knowledge and comprehension about things, into the feeling life;
and let that be thy knowledge and wisdom,
which thou receivest and retainest in the feeling life;
and that will lead thee into the footsteps of the flock, without reasoning, consulting,
or disputing.

Oh! wait to be taught and enabled by God to fetch right steps in thy travels,
and to take up the cross and despise the shame in everything, wherein that wisdom, will,
and mind, which is to be crucified, would be judge;
for it will judge amiss and lead aside, if it be hearkened to by thee.
The Lord show thee the snares and dangers to which thou art liable,
and lead thee out of them; that whatever hindereth may be discovered to thee,
and thy mind singly joined to that which discovereth,
that so it may be removed out of the way;
and all crooked things be made straight in thee, and the rough plain, and the high low,
and the low high, and the weak and foolish strong and wise,
and the wise and strong weak and foolish.
Oh! wait to feel and understand my words,
that thy conversation may be ordered aright by the power and wisdom of God;
and that thou mayst inwardly come to witness the glorious coming of Him,
who is the salvation of God, and in whom thou shalt not fail to see the salvation of God.

Thou must be very low, weak, and foolish, that the seed may arise in thee to exalt thee,
and become thy strength and wisdom; and thou must die exceedingly, again and again,
more and more,
inwardly and deeply! that thy life may spring up from the holy root and stock;
and thou mayest be more and more gathered into it, spring up into it,
and live alone in the life, virtue, and power thereof.
The travel is long, the exercises many, the snares, temptations, and dangers many;
and yet the mercy, relief, and help is great also.

Oh that thou mayst feel thy calling and election, thy sinking down, springing up,
and establishment in the pure seed, in the light and righteousness thereof over all;
that thou mayst sing songs of degrees to the Redeemer of Israel,
and mayest daily more and more partake of and rejoice in him, who is our joy,
and the crown thereof.

Thy friend, in the most sincere, tender love,

I+++.+++ P.

11th of Fifth Month, 1677

TO THOMAS WALMSLEY

FRIEND T. W.,

God is love: and he giveth love, and teacheth to love;
and with the love which my God hath given me, and wherewith he hath taught me to love,
have I loved thee, and sought the everlasting good of thy soul, even as of my own.

This morning, the consideration of thee was strong upon my spirit,
how that thou wast stricken in years, and must shortly pass out of this world,
and give an account to God; and this earnest desire was in my heart,
that thou mightest be fitted and rightly prepared, to give such an account, as the Lord,
the great, righteous and impartial Judge, might own and approve of, to thy eternal joy:
for which end, two things were upon my heart to propose to thee,
to be rightly considered by thee.

One is, whether thou canst truly say, as in God`'s sight,
that thou hast known and experienced Christ within, redeeming thee from sin within.
Hath Christ indeed brought salvation home to thy heart?
Hast thou known his inward, living power,
breaking the strength and power of Satan within thee?
Hast thou known Him stronger than the strong man inwardly?
Hast thou first known Christ knock at the door of thy heart,
and opened to and let him in;
and afterwards experienced what he doth in the heart where he is let in?
Or hast thou had only a notional knowledge and belief concerning Christ without,
and never known what it was to have the Son revealed in thee?
Oh that thou mightst know, and experimentally understand this Scripture,
before thou go hence and be no more seen,--"`If Christ be in you,
the body is dead because of sin`"--and this other also,--"`He that is Christ`'s hath crucified
the flesh with the affections and lusts.`" The Lord God make thee truly weighty and serious,
and rightly considerate, and give thee true, unerring judgment;
that thou mayst not be deceived about this thing,
which is of such deep and everlasting concernment to thy soul!

The other is,
whether thou dost experience the sprinkling of the
blood of the Lord Jesus upon thy conscience.
The Jews were saved by the sprinkling of the blood of the lamb outwardly.
The Lamb of God taketh away the sins of the world,
by the sprinkling of his blood inwardly.
Now, I beseech thee, consider:
hast thou only a notion of Christ`'s blood as it was shed without,
or dost thou also know the sprinkling within in thy own heart?
Hath God made that new covenant, the everlasting covenant with thee,
wherein the blood of sprinkling is felt, and the precious effects of it experienced?
for then, indeed, iniquities are forgiven, and sin remembered no more;
but the soul comes to witness real justification from sin,
and that peace which passeth understanding, which no man can give or take away;
neither doth any man know what it is, but he that hath it.
Oh that thou mayst know the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and be clothed with it, that thou mayst stand justified in God`'s sight forever,
at that great day!

I+++.+++ P.

12th of Eleventh Month, 1677

TO GEORGE WINKFIELD

DEAR FRIEND,

Two things stick upon my heart, since our last short discourse at the window at Kings,
through my desire that it may go well with thee,
and that thou mayst be right in God`'s sight.

One is, that saying of thine about thy love to truth and Friends,
as if it were as great as ever it was.
Now, I entreat thee to weigh this thing, and to wait on God to know,
whether it be really so or no; which thou mayst understand by this:
if thou be as really desirous, and waitest, as singly,
to know and obey the commands of truth as ever, then,
thy love to it is as great as formerly in its first heat and zeal; otherwise not.
"`He that hath my commandments and keepeth them,`" saith Christ,
"`he it is that loveth me.`" John 14:21. And hereby,
we know that our knowledge of him is true and living; because it leads, quickens,
and enables us to the keeping of his commandments. 1 John 2:3.

The other is, that thou saidst, thy heart is not hardened.
Oh! consider this seriously; for, if thy heart be hardened, and thou not sensible of it,
thy estate is exceeding dangerous.
Now, if the Lord by his power hath preserved thee out of that which hardens the heart;
then, without doubt, thy heart is not hardened:
but if the enemy hath tempted thee to let in reasonings into thy mind,
against any thing that is indeed of God;
and thou hast run into any practices contrary to truth, and justifiest them in thy heart,
from any reasonings and thoughts the enemy hath suggested
to and strengthened thy mind in;
then, without doubt, thy heart is so far hardened.
It is impossible for thee, or any one else, to let in that which hardens,
and not be hardened.

Oh! mind that precious advice of the Apostle. Heb. 3:13.
Mark, sin deceives, lust deceives,
desire after any thing that pleaseth the flesh, and is desirable to the worldly nature,
deceives.
And whoever is deceived by it, and lets it in (mind,
he doth not let it in as an evil thing, but is deceived by it),
his heart is hardened against that which would show him the evil of it,
and draw his mind from it, if he did in truth hearken to it,
and were not lulled asleep in the deceit.
And there must be a daily watching against that which deceives and hardens,
as the apostle there adviseth them to exhort one another unto,
lest the enemy at any time catch any of them in the snare of sin, and so harden them.

Now, he that would not provoke the Lord to give him up to full hardness,
must take heed of the degrees thereof; and happy is he who so doth.
O G.W.! consider, as before the Lord, whether thy walking be answerable to truth,
so far as thou knowest truth; and whether thou art willingly ignorant of any thing,
which the good God is willing and ready to give thee the knowledge of,
that thou mayst take the more liberty to the flesh in that, which the life of truth,
if felt, would soon condemn and draw from.

This is in most sincere love to thee, from him who hath always been thy friend.

I+++.+++ P.

11th of 12th Month, 1677

TO SIR WILLIAM DRAKE (so styled)

FIRST, There is a God, a holy, righteous, living, powerful God,
who made heaven and earth, and all things therein; and at last made man in his own image,
and set him over the works of his hands, to have dominion,
and to rule in his wisdom and power over them; and to guide, order, and make use of them,
to the glory of Him that made them.
Now, in this state, God was pleased and took delight in the works of his hands,
and in man above all.

Secondly, Man, sinning against his Maker, lost this image, which was his glory,
and became brutish in understanding, and an enemy to God in his mind,
and liable to the wrath of God`'s holy and righteous nature.

Thirdly, There is no reconciliation to be had between God and man any more,
but by the change of this nature in man: for God is unchangeable, he is light,
he is life, he is holiness unchangeable; and will never be reconciled to,
or have fellowship with, darkness,
with that which is dead and unholy,--which man in his fallen estate is,
until he be begotten again to God, changed and renewed from his evil and sinful nature,
into a good and holy nature, and till he be turned from evil works,
and know what it is to be the workmanship of God, created anew unto good works.

Fourthly, Nothing can produce this change in man, but the Spirit and power of Christ,
but the grace and truth which is by Jesus Christ.
Therefore a man had need be sure that he receive this Spirit and power,
and that he feel the operative, changing virtue of it, and be really changed thereby,
being created anew, begotten anew to God, in the holiness and righteousness of truth,
a son and servant to the living God;
or he can never know what belongs to true reconciliation with God,
and to fellowship with him in the light and life of his Son.

Fifthly, All the religions and professions upon the face of the earth,
which fall short of this Spirit, life, and power,
and wherein this new creation in Christ Jesus is not witnessed,
nor power received to abstain from what is evil, and to become sons to God,
are not the pure, powerful, gospel religion,
wherein the divine virtue and power of life operates;
but that which men in the earthly wisdom have formed without life.
And all religions that have but a form of godliness, and not the power,
are to be turned away from, and witnessed against,
by such as are called forth to be witnesses to the true,
gospel religion and way of worship, which stands in Spirit, life, and power.

Sixthly, This religion and worship, which stands in Spirit, life, and power,
is the religion and worship which Christ set up about sixteen hundred years ago. John 4:23-24.
1 Cor. 4:20. Rom. 6:4. And this
is the religion which God hath revived and set up again,
as they that receive the gospel now preach it; and believing in the power,
which is both outwardly testified of, and also inwardly revealed,
they have the witness of it in their own hearts. Rev. 14:6-7.
1 John 5:10-12. Isa. 53:1. Oh, how sweet are these scriptures,
when they are rightly read and rightly understood,
the Lord giving the right understanding, and leading into the true experience of them!

Friend, thou expressed to one of my youngest sons, as he related to me,
that thou hadst a desire I should visit thee,
that thou mightst have some discourse with me about religion.
That is the most profitable kind of discourse that can be,
if it be ordered in the fear of the Lord, and in a weighty sense and dread of him.
I am very serious in reference to religion, and would not therein mistake or miscarry,
by any means; and if I might be helpful to thee, or to any man,
as to the truth and power of religion, it would be matter of gladness to my heart,
and of praising and blessing the Lord,
in the sense of his stretching forth his hand towards the saving of any.
Now, that our meeting and discourse may be the more solemn and advantageous,
I have sent thee a few plain propositions to consider of;
which I do not only find signified of in the Scriptures,
but the Lord hath also written them on my heart; and if they be plain to thee,
and thou be also in the serious sense of them,
it may tend towards the making of our discourse the more easy and profitable.

These are the main things; and he that is rightly grounded, I mean,
in the true and sensible experience of them in his heart,
cannot miss of God`'s guidance to make a safe and happy progress therein;
he daily waiting upon the Lord, to be taught and led by him, further and further,
into the life, Spirit, and power of truth;
so that he shall be taught of God to know his Son Jesus Christ,
and the freedom which is by the truth as it is in Jesus, daily more and more;
which it is my soul`'s sincere and single desire, that thou, thy wife,
and family may be experiencers and happy partakers of.

Oh, what a glorious state was man once in,
before his transgressing the holy law of God! but when he sinned,
how did he fall short of the glory of God!
Yet, as he hears His voice, and follows Him, that leads out of sin into the image of God,
into the holiness and righteousness of truth; how is he brought back by the Lord,
and how doth he return, in the blessed leadings of God`'s blessed Spirit,
into the glory of God again!
Read 2 Cor. 3:18; and, oh that thou mayst livingly and sensibly know what it means!

I remain an acknowledger of thy kindness, and a desirer for thee,
that thou mayst obtain from God the knowledge of himself and his Son,
which is experienced, by them that receive it, to be, indeed life eternal.

TO THE WOMEN`'s MEETING OF FRIENDS IN THE TRUTH, AT JOHN MANNOCK`'s

DEAR FRIENDS,

Dearly beloved and honored in the Lord, because of his honorable presence and power,
which is so preciously manifested and found to be among you in your meetings.

Blessed be the Lord, who hath thus gathered you! and given you hearts to meet together,
to feel his precious presence and power, and wait to do his will therein,
as he shall please to call, and make your way clear thereto.
And, blessed be the Lord! who doth encourage and reward you daily,
and make your meetings pleasant and advantageous to your own souls,
and towards the seasoning and holy watching over
the several respective places where your lot is fallen.

Oh! what could the Lord do more for his people,
than to turn them to that pure seed of life, which will make them all alive,
and keep them all in life and purity;
and then to make use of every living member in the living body,
as his Spirit shall please to breathe upon it, and his power actuate it?
And indeed, there is need of all the life and power to the body,
which the Lord sees good to bestow on any member of it;
every member of the body having life given it, not only for itself,
but likewise for the use and service of the body.
Only, dear Friends, here is to be the great care,
that every member keep within the limits of life,
wherein its capacity and ability for service lies, and out of which,
it can do no real service for God, or to the body.
Oh, therefore, eye life, eye the power,
eye the presence of the Lord with your spirits! that he may go along with you,
and guide you in every thought ye think, in every word ye speak,
in reference to his work and service.

And mind, Friends, what is now upon me to you: it is one thing,
to sit waiting to feel the power, and to keep within the limits of the power, thus far;
and another, yea, and harder, to feel and keep within the sense and limits of the power,
when ye come to act.
Then your reasonings, your wisdom, your apprehensions,
have more advantage to get up in you, and to put themselves forth.
Oh! therefore watch narrowly and diligently against the forward part;
and keep back to the life, which, though it rise more slowly,
yet acts more surely and safely for God.

Oh, wait and watch, to feel your Keeper keeping you within the holy bounds and limits,
within the pure fear, within the living sense,
while ye are acting for your God! that ye may only be his instruments,
and feel him acting in you.
Therefore every one wait to feel the Judge risen and up, and the judgment set,
in your own hearts; that, what ariseth in you, may be judged,
and nothing may pass from you publicly,
but what hath first passed the pure judgment in your own breasts.
And let the holy rule of the blessed apostle James, be always upon your spirits,
"`Let every one be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.`" Oh,
let not a talkativeness have place in any of you! but, abide in such gravity, modesty,
and weightiness of spirit,
as becomes the judgment seat of the Spirit and power of the Lord.
Ye can never wait too much for the power, nor can ye ever act too much in the power;
but ye may easily act too much without it.

And as for this troublesome,
contentious business (if the Lord should yet order it to be brought before you),
the Lord teach you to consider of, and manage it in a wise, tender, and healing spirit.
Ye must distinguish in judgment, if ye judge aright, between enemies and erring friends.
And take heed of the quickness and strength of reason, or of the natural part,
which avails little: but wait for the evidence and demonstration of God`'s Spirit,
which reaches to the witness and doth the work.
Are they in a snare?
are they overtaken in a fault?
yea, are they in measure blinded and hardened, so that they can neither see nor feel,
as to this particular?
Retire, sit still awhile, and travail for them.
Feel how life will arise in any of you, and how mercy will reach towards them;
and how living words, from the tender sense, may be reached forth to their hearts,
deeply, by the hand of the Lord, for their good.
And if ye find them, at length, bowing to the Lord, oh,
let tender compassion help them forwards! that what hath been so
troublesome and groundedly dissatisfactory in the progress,
may, at length, have a sweet issue for their good, and our joy and rejoicing in the Lord.

So, my dear friends, the Lord be with you, and guide you in this,
and in all that he shall further call you to; and multiply his presence, power,
and blessings upon you, and make your meetings as serviceable to the honor of his name,
as he himself would have them, and as you yourselves can desire them to be.

Your friend and brother in the tender truth, and in the pure love and precious life.

TO THOSE PERSONS THAT DRINK OF THE WATERS AT ASTROP WELLS

THERE is a great God, the Creator of all things, who gave man a being here in this world;
to whom every man must give an account, when he goes out of this world.

This great God, who loves mankind, and would not have them perish, is nigh unto man,
to teach him the fear, which is due from him to God.
The man that learns this pure fear of God is daily
exercised by it in departing from evil,
both in thought, word, and deed, and in doing that which is good in his sight.

There is likewise another teacher near man,
who is also ready to teach such as do not know God, or fear God,
that which is dishonorable to the great God, who made man a vessel of honor,
and to be to his glory.
They that learn of this teacher learn not to fear God, or to do good,
but to please themselves in doing evil, both in thought, word, and deed.
Oh! what account will all such give, when they go out of this world,
and come to be judged by the great God (who is of pure eyes, and cannot behold iniquity),
when all their sins are set in order by him before them,
and just judgment proportioned by him thereunto?
Oh! why do men forget God their Creator, days without number,
hearkening to him who first deceived them,
doing the will of the deceiver and destroyer of souls,
and not the will of the blessed Creator and Saviour?

Oh, hearken to wisdom`'s counsel,
when she cries in the streets of your hearts against that which is evil,
and contrary to the nature, life, and will of God;
lest a day of calamity from God come upon you,
and then ye cry unto the pitiful and tender God, and his bowels be turned against you,
and he refuse to show mercy to you!
Read Prov. 1:20 to the end of the chapter;
and the Lord give you the weighty consideration and
true understanding of it for your soul`'s good,
and for the reclaiming of you from any thing that is evil, and destructive to your souls.

This is written in tender love unto you, from one who pities and loves you,
and desires your prosperity in this world,
and your everlasting happiness with God forever.

I+++.+++ P.

Astrop, 15th of Sixth Month, 1678

TO SUCH AS DRINK OF THE WATERS AT ASTROP WELLS

I ENTREAT you to consider what is within written for your eternal good;
and be not deceived by the enemy of your souls, in things of an everlasting concern.

Some queries propounded to your consideration,
in the tender melting love of my heart towards your everlasting welfare.

First query.
Is not the great God, who created heaven and earth, light, pure light, spiritual light,
eternal light, in whom is no darkness at all? 1 John 1:5.

Second query.
Is not man, in his natural, unregenerate, corrupt state, darkness?
And can he possibly, in that state,
have any union or fellowship with the great God and Saviour?
See Eph. 5:8. 2 Cor. 4:6. 1 John 1:6.

Third query.
Doth not the great God, in his tender love to mankind, cause his pure,
heavenly light to shine in man`'s heart, in this his dark and corrupt state? 2 Cor. 6:6.
John 1:5.

Fourth query.
What is the end of God`'s causing his pure light to shine in man`'s corrupt heart?
Is it not, that man might be turned from darkness, and from the power of Satan,
which keeps him in darkness, to the light which God causeth to shine in him,
and to God from whom this light comes? Acts 26:18.
that so, following Christ, and not walking in darkness,
he might obtain the light of life? John 8:12.

Fifth query.
Doth man, in his natural corrupt state, love this light, when it shines in him;
or rather hate it?
And can he hate it, without hating God from whom it comes, and of whose nature it is?

Sixth query.
Why doth man, in his natural corrupt state, hate this light?
Is it not, because his deeds are evil; and because he would continue in his evil deeds,
without being disturbed or reclaimed by this light?
John 3:19 to 21.

Seventh query.
What does the light of the pure God, and of his Christ,
do for them that receive and obey it?
Doth it not bring them out of darkness, and change their nature;
so that they become children of the light, and no more darkness, as they were before,
but light in the Lord? John 12:36.
Eph. 5:8.

Eighth query.
How shall it fare with those,
who receive the shinings of this light of God and Christ in their consciences,
hearkening to the reproofs of it, eschewing that which it shows to be evil,
and doing that which God by it shows to be good?
Shall not they receive the remission of their sins from God,
and an inheritance among the saints in light? Acts 26:18.
ColoSong. 1:12-13.

Ninth query.
What will become of those, who do not mind the shining of God`'s light in their hearts,
nor are turned to it, nor changed by it;
but spend their time in what pleaseth the corrupt part in themselves?
Will they not be separated, when they go out of this world, from God, who is light,
and have their portion with dark spirits, in utter darkness?
2 Thess. 1:6, to 10. See also Matt. 25:30.

Oh, consider these things, while ye have time,
for your souls`' eternal good! that ye miss not of the holy way of life and salvation,
and so perish; whom God would not have perish, but stretcheth forth his hand of love,
by his inward "`light of life,`" effectually to save your souls.

Astrop, 20th of Sixth Month, 1678

TO ONE WHO SENT A MESSAGE TO HIM FROM ASTROP WELLS

I HAD no end in writing or sending those papers, but true love to your immortal souls;
that ye might seriously consider thereof, and be found in the practice of them,
and so be happy forever.
For as Christ said to his disciples, so it is with me in this case towards you,
"`If ye know these things,
happy are ye if ye do them.`" I have felt the sweetness
and great benefit of the practice of them,
which I heartily desire ye may also experience.

I here send enclosed a token of my love to thee in particular,
which thy courteous message drew from me.
It contains, in a few words, the true path-way of salvation; which,
though thou mayst know already,
yet the reading and serious consideration thereof may not be unserviceable to thee.

I am thy friend, in true love and desires for thee,

THE PLAIN PATH-WAY OF SALVATION

The Lord Jesus Christ is the only Saviour.

Grace and truth comes by Jesus Christ.

The Lord Jesus Christ saves by the grace and truth which comes by him.

For it is the grace of God that brings salvation, and it is the truth, as it is in Jesus,
which makes free indeed.

He, therefore, that would be saved from sin and condemnation,
must wait for the inward manifesting and revealing of the grace and truth in his heart;
and must receive it, and be subject to it, learning of the grace,
to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts in every kind;
and he must learn of the truth as it is in Jesus,
to deny whatever is contrary to the life, nature, and Spirit of Jesus.
He must likewise learn of the grace and truth to fear God; to turn from all false,
invented worships and ways of men, and to worship God, the Father of spirits,
in spirit and in truth: and as he learns and practises this,
he will also learn of the grace and truth to live
soberly and righteously in this present world,
yea, and godlily also, even as the holy God would have him;
for God would have men live no otherwise, than as his grace and truth teaches them.
Now God`'s grace and truth, and the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,
which is written in the inward parts, do not only teach that which is good,
and to deny and depart from that which is evil, but give ability so to do.
"`My grace is sufficient for thee,`" said God to Paul.
And the truth of Jesus, revealed inwardly, hath virtue and power in it;
insomuch that they who receive the grace and truth which comes by Jesus Christ,
receive power to become sons to God.
For the grace, the truth, is not a notional thing, but hath the virtue and power of life,
and mortification in it; and they that truly receive it,
partake of its virtue and power in operation and exercise of it in their hearts,
and are thereby really made dead unto sin, and alive unto God.

So then, he that knows the grace and truth which comes by Jesus Christ, receives it,
learns of it, is subject to it, and partakes of its virtue and power,
he knows Christ unto salvation; but he that knows not, receives not,
is not subject to the grace, doth not experience the sufficiency of the grace,
nor witness ability and power through it to become a son to God,
and to do the will of God,--he doth not yet at all know
the Lord Jesus Christ unto the salvation of his soul,
notwithstanding whatsoever he may profess or believe concerning him.

TO THE WOMEN FRIENDS THAT MEET AT ARMSCOT IN WORCESTERSHIRE

DEAR FRIENDS,

In your meetings together to do service for the Lord,
be every one of you very careful and diligent in watching to his power,
that ye may have the sensible, living feeling of it, each of you in your own hearts,
and in the hearts one of another; and that ye may keep within the limits of it,
and not think, or speak, or act beyond it.
And know, oh! wait more and more to know, how to keep that silence,
which is of the power; that in every one of you, what the power would have silent,
may be silent.
Oh! take heed of the forwardness of the flesh, the wisdom of the flesh,
the will of the flesh, the talkativeness of the flesh; keep them back,
oh! let them forever be kept back in every one of you,
by the presence and virtue of the power.

The power is the authority and blessing of your meetings,
and therein lies your ability to perform what God requires; be sure ye have it with you.
Keep back to the life, keep low in the holy fear, and ye shall not miss of it.
You will find it easy to transgress, easy to set up self,
easy to run into sudden apprehensions about things,
and one to be of this mind and another of that; but feel the power to keep down all this,
and to keep you out of all this; every one watching to the life,
when and where it will arise to help you,
and that ye may be sensible of it when it doth arise,
and not in a wrong wisdom oppose it, but be one with it.
And thus,
if any thing should arise from the wrong wisdom in any ye may be sensible of it,
not defiled or entangled with it,
but abiding in that which sees through it and judges it; that so,
life may reign in your hearts and in your meetings, above that which will be forward,
and perking over the life, if ye be not very watchful.

So the Lord God of my life be with you, and season your hearts with his grace and truth,
and daily keep you in the savor thereof; that ye may be blessed by him,
and a blessing in his hands;
all that is evil and contrary to truth being kept down in your own hearts,
ye will be fit to keep down evil in the minds and hearts of others;
and if any thing be unsavory anywhere, it will be searched into, judged, cast out,
and the recovery of the soul which hath let it in sought,
that if possible it may be restored; and then,
ye will know the joy of seeking out and bringing back the lost sheep.
And be tender to others, in true compassion, as ye would be tendered by others,
if ye were in their conditions.

There is that near you, which will guide you; oh! wait for it, and be sure ye keep to it;
that, being innocent and faithful, in following the Lord in the leadings of his power,
his power may plead your cause in the hearts of all his tender people hereabouts;
and they may see and acknowledge,
that your meetings are of God,--that ye are guided by him into that way of service,
in his holy fear, in which he himself is with you,
and by the movings of his Holy Spirit in your hearts, hath engaged you.
Be not hasty, either in conceiving any thing in your minds, or in speaking it forth,
or in any thing ye are to do; but feel him by his Spirit and life going along with you,
and leading you into what he would have any of you, or every one of you do.
If ye be in the true feeling sense of what the Lord your God would have done,
and join with what is of God, as it riseth in any,
or against any thing that is not of God as it is made manifest among you;
ye are all in your places and proper services, obeying the blessed will,
and doing the blessed work, of the Lord your God.

I had somewhat upon me yesterday to you, but my weakness was great.
This morning, this lay as a weight upon my spirit to lay upon yours;
may the weight of it come upon you,
to weigh down whatever is light or chaffy in any of you,
that the seed of life may come up over it, and ye may be weighty before the Lord,
in the weighty seed of life.
The Lord make you rightly serviceable to him, and truly glorious in your meetings,
and in your several places.
Ye will find a great work to keep one part down,
that that which is pure and living of God may come up in you, and ye act only in it,
not exceeding the limits of it.

TO THE SCHOLARS THAT DISTURB FRIENDS, IN THEIR MEETINGS AT OXFORD

I heard such jeering yesterday, at Being moved by the Spirit of God,
as indeed grieved me;
because I was and am sensible of the great hurt it
doth to those that give scope to themselves therein.
Now, I entreat such to consider, doth not Christ say, '`It is the Spirit that quickens?`'
Is not man dead in trespasses and sins, till the Lord quicken him to life,
by his Holy Spirit?
And when the soul is in any measure made alive,
doth it not feel the want of God`'s Spirit to keep it alive, and to add life to it?
And is not this the great thing, the soul cries to God for,
even that Spirit whereby alone it can live to God, and be preserved alive before Him?
Did not David pray to God that the Lord would quicken and uphold him by his free Spirit?
And again, '`Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me?`'
And did not Christ say, relating to the similitude of parents, '`If ye being evil,
know how to give good gifts to your children,
how much more shall your heavenly Father give his Spirit to them that ask Him?`'
And they that ask the Spirit of Him, when He gives it, will they not gladly receive it?
And when it is received, will it not move them unto good, and against evil;
and ought not they to wait to be moved by it?
Doth not the natural life and spirit move in the natural body;
and shall not the spiritual life live and move in the inward man;
and they which are truly alive be moved and guided by it?
They that have not the Spirit of God, are they his?
And they that have his Spirit, is it not a Spirit of light, of life, of righteousness,
of holiness, of grace, of truth, etc.;
and ought not all the children of the light and of the truth, to wait for its motions,
that they may follow its leadings and guidings?
Did not the Christians of old live in the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit,
and not fulfill the lusts of the flesh?
And ought not all the Christians now to do also?
'`If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye, through the Spirit,
do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.`'
O! wait, that ye may experience those things;
and do not disturb or deride others in their waiting upon God,
to experience those things, even now and more: who cannot but mourn and pray for you,
while ye are doing towards them that which ye ought not.
The Lord give you rightly to wait for true understanding;
that ye may receive it from Him in these and all
other things that concern your everlasting welfare.

This is in true love and good-will to you, from him who wisheth well to your souls:
even that ye may know, partake of, and rejoice in God`'s salvation.
