== Chapter XI. Some Directions to the Panting Soul

[quote, , Matt. 11:28-30.]
____
"`Come unto me, all you that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart,
and you shall find rest unto your souls; for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.`"
____

Some sweet meditations sprang in my heart concerning this portion of Scripture,
with breathings of spirit and tender affections towards those "`that
labor and are heavy laden,`" which I find myself drawn to communicate.

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ The soul's true rest is in the gospel (which is "`the power of God
unto salvation.`") Here is the truth with regard to the kingdom,
wherein is life, joy, peace, and everlasting rest to the soul in God.
The law had the shadow of the good things to come,
but under the law there was not the possession of the good things themselves,
but only a laboring after them, and a mourning and burden because of the lack of them.
But in the gospel is the substance and enjoyment,
where life and immortality are brought to light and an
entrance into the everlasting kingdom is experienced,
possessed, and enjoyed.
"`The kingdom of heaven is at hand,`" says the forerunner; it is come, says the Messiah;
and in it there is righteousness, and peace, and joy in the pure Spirit of life.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ It is the will of the King of saints that his people
should enjoy the rest and peace of his gospel.
He does not desire them to be always laboring and heavy laden as under the law,
but he would have their souls experience and enjoy the ease, the liberty, the sweetness,
the pure power and eternal rest of his life.
The Spirit of the Lord was upon him to preach glad tidings to the meek,
liberty to the captives, life to the dead, the opening of the prison door,
the binding-up of the broken-hearted, the pouring in of oil upon the wounded.
The Lord desires to have the souls of his people enjoy that which he came to bring them.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ Christ has plainly marked out the path of his rest to every weary, panting soul,
which he that walks in cannot miss.
He has made the way plain in the gospel, so plain, that the traveling man, though a fool,
yet keeping to the light of the gospel, cannot err therein, or miss its blessed rest.
What is the way?
Why, "`Come unto me; take my yoke upon you and learn of me.`"
He that walks in this path cannot miss it.
The rest is at the end of it.
No, rather, the rest is in it--"`He that believes enters into the rest.`"
The true faith, the faith which stands in the power of God
and which is given to the one born from above,
this faith is the substance of the rest hoped for,
and there is a true taste and some real enjoyment of it given to him that truly believes.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ The rest was once felt and enjoyed when the gospel was known in power.
Believers, in the first days of the gospel
(before the night overtook that glorious dispensation)
found "`peace and joy in believing;`" indeed,
they could rejoice in the Lord always.
They felt the power and the life which stood over all the powers of darkness,
and brought good to them out of every affliction, temptation, and distress.
They stood in the life and in the power which
had quickened them and was present with them,
and so they could "`count it all joy when they fell into manifold
temptations,`" knowing the advantage which would accrue to them thereby,
and possessing their souls in the pure patience till God wrought it out for them.
They had an entrance ministered to them into the everlasting kingdom.
They received the king­dom which could not be shaken,
and in it had fellowship with the Father and with the Son,
and in the eternal light the blood ran in their vessels,
which cleansed them and kept them pure.
They sat down with Christ in the heavenly places,
even everyone in the particular mansion which God had built in them by his Spirit.
The fear of the living God was put in their hearts.
The Spirit of the Lord was within them,
and there his law was written and read in the Spirit,
and the treasures of his kingdom were opened by
the key of David in the hand of the Spirit.
Thus their souls had true satisfaction and rest in measure,
and were traveling on towards the fullness.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ There is no rest to be enjoyed in the gospel
for the soul that is out from under the yoke.
The true rest is found in that thing which yokes down
all that is at ease and at liberty outside of the life.
Only when that which is yoked down is consumed and destroyed is the liberty known;
and then it is no longer felt to be a yoke, but rather perfect freedom.
But the same thing which is the liberty is also the yoke; and under the yoke,
the sweetness, the ease, the safe possession of the life is enjoyed.
Mark this therefore diligently: the yoke is not one thing and the liberty another;
but they are one and the same.
The power of God, the life everlasting, the pure light, the divine nature,
is a yoke to the transgressing nature; but it is the ease, the pleasure, the rest,
the peace, the joy, of that which is born of God.

Now to the soul that has felt breathings towards the Lord formerly,
and in whom there are yet any true breathings left after his living
presence and the experience of his eternal virtue in the heart,
I have this to say: Where are you?
Are you in your soul's rest?
Do you experience the virtue and power of the gospel?
Is your laboring for life in a good degree at an end?
And do you experience the life and power flowing in upon you from the free fountain?
Is the load really taken off from your back?
Do you find the captive redeemed and set free from the power of sin,
and the captivity broken?
Is he who led you captive away from the eternal life and power
now led captive by the life and by the eternal redeeming power?
Have you found this, or have you missed it?
Let your heart answer.
Oh, do not imagine and talk away the rest and salvation of your soul!

The gospel state is a state of substance, a state of enjoying the life,
a state of experiencing the presence and power of the Lord in his pure, holy Spirit.
It is a state of binding up, a state of healing,
a state of knowing the Lord and walking with him in the light of his own Spirit.
It begins in a sweet, powerful touch of life,
and there is a growth in the life (in the power, in the divine virtue, in the rest,
peace, and satisfaction of the soul in God) to be administered and waited for daily.
Are you now here, in the living power, in the divine life, joined to the spring of life,
drawing water of life out of the well of life with joy?
Or are you dry, dead, barren, sapless,
or at best unsatisfied and mourning after what you lack?
You then that are dry, dead and barren,
as it were without the living God (who do not know the shining of his sun,
nor the descending of his dews from on high upon his tender plants),
oh wait for the life-giving virtue, for the visitations of the dayspring from on high!
Wait for him that you may be made alive again to God,
that you may find his life visiting you, his Spirit breathing upon you.
Turn and wait that the seed of Jacob may be
raised in you to travel out of this barren state,
even out of this land of darkness, and from under the shadow of death,
to the land where life lives and flourishes.
Know the land that daily distributes plentiful nourishment and
refreshment to all its offspring who are taught to wait for it,
and to feed on it in the holy place, out of the sight of the eye of the fleshly wisdom.

And you who are still gasping after the living God,
upon whom the breathings of life still abide,
who remain unsatisfied inwardly for lack of the presence of the Lord,
and whose hearts still mourn and lament deeply after him, oh consider what is the matter!
Consider why it is you have mourned so long, and sought so long,
and yet to this day are at a distance from the
thing you have mourned for and sought after!

"`Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leads unto life,
and few there be that find it.`"
The way of unbelief is broad, indeed, but the way of belief is broad also.
It is easy for a man to believe concerning Christ,
or in Christ (as his heart may call it),
so as to miss the nature of the true faith and all the
sweet and blessed effects which accompany it.
It is easy likewise to miss the yoke, or to take up a wrong yoke, in the self-will,
self-wisdom, self-interpretation of Scriptures.
It is easy to turn aside from the true yoke,
but it is hard coming under the yoke of the life, and hard abiding under it.
Again, it is easy to learn wrongly.
A man may read and hear in such a way that he may be always
learning and never come to the knowledge of the truth,
that is, never come to the truth as it is received and held in Jesus.
And if a man so misses the way, how can he attain the goal?
If one does not begin in the true faith, in the living faith,
how can he attain the rest to which the true faith alone leads?
If a man misses the yoke, or abides not constantly under the yoke,
how can he meet with the true ease and rest which is in it,
and which it alone can administer?
If a man does not learn the truth aright from the true teacher,
how can he ever reap the effects of the true knowledge?
Ah, poor hearts!
It is not enough to have breathings after God,
nor to be very diligent and industrious either in
outward ordinances or inward exercises of spirit.
The way of the gospel must be cast open by God, and the soul led into it by him,
and daily preserved by him.
A soul must walk in the path which is proper for it to walk in,
otherwise it may mourn and cry all its days,
and yet never meet with that enjoyment of God, and satisfaction in God,
which it waits for and cries after.
It is one thing to mourn after a gospel-state,
but another thing to be brought into it by the power.
With my heart I acknowledge those that mourn after and feel their lack of God,
wherever they are.
But this I know certainly,
that they can never come to the enjoyment of him except in that living path
which the Scriptures testify of to be in him who is the life.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
But how can my poor soul that has long mourned and
groaned and been sick of love after my beloved,
come to walk in his path, so that I may meet with, and lie down in,
the power of life and salvation which the gospel holds forth to the true believer?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: You who desire to enjoy your beloved, and to experience the rest of his gospel,
and to walk in that path which leads to him,
wait to learn of the Spirit these following things:

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ Know what it is that can walk in the path of life,
and indeed is alone capable of walking therein.
It is that which groans and mourns, that which is begotten of God in you.
The path of life is for the seed of life.
The true knowledge of the way, with the walking in the way, is reserved for God's child,
for God's traveler.
Therefore, keep in the regeneration, keep in the birth; be no more than God has made you.
Give over your own willing; give over your own running;
give over your own desiring to know or to be anything.
Sink down to the seed which God sows in the heart, and let that grow in you,
and be in you, and breathe in you, and act in you,
and you will find by sweet experience that the Lord knows, loves,
and acknowledges that seed, and will lead it to the inheritance of life,
which is his portion.
And as you take up the cross to yourself,
and allow that seed to overspread and become a yoke over you, you will become renewed,
and enjoy life, and the everlasting inheritance in the seed.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ Know the light of the Spirit in which you must walk.
There the child is begotten (not in Satan's darkness, nor in the light of man's wisdom,
searching knowledge, or comprehension), and there it walks.
In that light the child finds every step and motion towards the land of life.
Therefore, hold no knowledge out of the Spirit.
If any knowledge concerning the things of God be held out of the freshness of the Spirit,
it presently proves dead and unprofitable.
The spiritual Israel cannot travel without a spiritual light,
which light is eternal and incomprehensible, and cannot be held by man's spirit.
This light shines fresh in the renewed spirit every day,
and so is daily gathering it more and more inward into itself,
comprehending it in itself, and preserving it in its own purity, clearness,
and brightness.

Now this has been the downfall of many: even catching some light from the Spirit,
and then transplanting the image of divine things into the earthly nature,
and there holding it in the earthly part.
In this way man seeks to grow wise, and to make use of spiritual things as he sees good,
and does not see the necessity of depending on the Spirit for
fresh light and life every day for every spiritual motion.
Thus the traveler soon comes to lose the true path,
and instead travels on in a road of his own wisdom's forming.
And such a man seems to himself to make a large progress,
yet he makes no true progress at all,
but has gone exceedingly far in the wrong direction,
which ground he must traverse back again before
he can come to the truth of his former state,
or proceed on in the true way.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ Know and keep to the power, which alone began any true work in the heart,
which alone can preserve it, and which alone can carry it on.
Christ was made a priest, not after the law of a carnal commandment,
but after the power of an endless life.
And every priest under him (which every true
believer is) is also made so by the same power.
The powers of darkness are continually at hand,
against which nothing can stand without being in that power which is above them.

Now, the soul's first coming to Christ must be in the power of the Father's drawing;
and no believing afterwards is of the right nature
except what abides in and goes forth in the same power.
So the taking up the yoke, and the soul's travel and progress in it,
must be by the power of the new life, and so must be all of the disciple's learning.
As the master teaches in the power of the Spirit the
things which alone can be seen with the new eye,
heard with the new ear, and received into the new heart,
so the student must learn and receive his lessons of life in the same power.
If any disciple of Christ be out from under the shadow of the power,
believing without the power, walking without the power, acting without the power,
he is out from that wherein his life stands,
and from wherein alone he finds preservation.
And oh, how liable is such a one to the pits, bruises, snares,
and temptations of the enemy!

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ Watch against the selfish wisdom in every step of your growth,
that it does not come between you and your life.
Be watchful that you are not deceived with a likeness, a shadow,
making it appear more pleasing to the eye than the substance.
In every step of your way it will be laying snares for you;
and it is easy for deceit to enter you at any time,
and for fleshly wisdom to rise up in you under an appearance of spiritual wisdom,
unless the Lord tenderly and powerfully preserve you.
If the wrong wisdom prevails, it will lead you from the path of the true wisdom;
it will deceive you with a false faith, instead of the true faith, with false praying,
instead of the breathings of the true child, with diligence and zeal in the false way,
instead of the true zeal and diligence.
Indeed, it will hurry you along in the path of error,
shutting that eye in you which can see,
and hardening your heart against your truest friend.
And being thus deceived,
you may become as zealous in your age and generation
against the truth as the Jews were in theirs.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ Let nothing judge in you (concerning your own heart, or concerning others,
or concerning any way or truth of God) except that which is begotten of God in the heart.
Let the light in which you are begotten to God, and which shines upon his begotten,
be the only judge in you, and then you cannot err in judgment.
Be not hasty, be not forward in judgment; keep back to the life,
still waiting for the appearance and openings of the life.
A few steps gained in the life and power of God are much safer
and sweeter than a hasty progress in the hasty,
forward spirit.

Indeed this is the true religion--the experience of
God's Spirit beginning something in the heart,
the heart's waiting on him for more of his Spirit, and walking on with him in his Spirit,
as he pleases to make alive, lead, draw, and strengthen.
Indeed there is no duty or ordinance of the gospel outside of the Spirit.
It is easy, however,
to commend and practice the likeness of these things without the Spirit,
and then that which was of God in the heart soon withers,
and a contrary building is raised, and the state of the heart changed.
Oh wait on the Lord that he may give you to understand these things!

[.discourse-part]
Question: But how may I know and keep to the begotten of God,
and to the light and power of the Lord,
and keep down the fleshly wisdom and comprehension concerning the things of God?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: When God begets life in the heart, there is a savor of it in your vessel,
and a secret, living warmth and virtue which the heart in some measure feels,
whereby life is known.
Lie low in the fear of the Most High that this leaven may grow and increase in you.
This is the leaven of the kingdom.
This is it which must change your heart and nature, and make your vessel
(which perhaps has been long and much corrupted)
fit to receive the treasure of the kingdom.

Now while the savor is upon you, while the virtue of the life is fresh in you,
you will find some strength towards God,
with some little taste and discerning of the things of his kingdom.
Know your weakness, and do not go beyond the measure;
but in what you have received bow before the fullness, worship God in that,
and be patient however he deals with you, waiting for more from him.
And when the night comes upon you, and you are perhaps at a loss,
missing the savor and presence of the life, and not knowing how to come by it again,
be patient and still, and you will find breathings after a fresh visitation, and a meek,
humble, broken spirit before the Lord.
You will see that you can do nothing to recover his presence again; no,
you cannot so much as wait for him, or breathe after him, without his help.
But he is close to the poor, close to the broken, close to the distressed,
close to the helpless.
Oh do not, with your fleshly cries and roarings,
think to awaken your beloved before his season!
But in the night of distress,
feel after that which may quiet and stay your heart till the next springing of the day.
The sun will arise, which will scatter the clouds,
and he is near who will give you hope that you will yet see God,
and find again the quickenings and leadings of his Spirit.
And in the day of his power you will find strength to walk with him; yes,
in the day of your weakness his grace will be sufficient for you.
He will nurture you up in his life by his pure Spirit,
causing you to grow under his shadow.
He will be teaching you to live, and to speak, and to move and act from the seed,
and within the compass of his light and life eternal.
Only be not wise to catch the notion of things into the earthly part,
where the moth can corrupt, and where the thief can break through and steal.
But come to know the divine treasury,
where all the things of life are treasured up by the Spirit,
and handed forth to the living child with fresh life, according to its need of them.

In this way your heart will be kept close to God,
and your spiritual senses continually exercised about the things of God.
It will be easy for you to know the shepherd's voice,
and to distinguish the sound of the Spirit in your own heart.
And he who tries spirits and motions in your own heart,
will also give you the discerning of truth and error elsewhere,
even between the Spirit of God and the spirit of Satan in others.
You will be able to try not only words, but spirits,
becoming acquainted with the anointing which tastes all things,
and will allow you to judge, not by the words, but by the power.
For to you, being in the power, in the anointing, in the savor,
it will become natural to feel, to taste,
to know and unite with what is one with your life,
what comes from the same spirit in others, and also to turn from the contrary.
And thus your life, your growth, your path will be sweet, safe, clear, certain,
demonstrative in the Spirit, and past all reasonings of flesh and blood,
either in yourself or in others.
Even the beginnings of life eternal are of a higher nature than man can come at.
Man's wisdom and knowledge concerning the things of God is but brutish before it.
But as you come into that life, and abide and grow in that life,
you are beyond man's judgment, and are able to judge man, and discern his whole course.

=== On Worshiping the Living God

I have had deep experience concerning the worship of God from a child,
having travailed in spirit with my God for the right knowledge thereof,
and in singleness of heart I have given up unto
him according as he has taught and led my poor,
needy, depending soul.
Now the worship of God is a weighty thing,
and there have been (and still are) so many errors about it.
These errors are of such dangerous consequence,
both in relation to men's eternal state hereafter, and to their right constitution,
peace, and welfare in this world.
Therefore is it on my heart to answer a few questions concerning the worship of God,
for the service of such as both desire and need instruction therein.

[.discourse-part]
Question 1: Who is the acceptable worshiper in the sight of God?
Or to whom has God held forth his worship in the sight of the world,
since he rejected the Jews with their worship?

It is not every man that would thrust himself
upon the Lord whom the Lord will accept;
but "`the true worshipers will worship in spirit and truth,
for the Father seeks such to worship him.`" John 4:23.
There is a capacity to be found in man to make him a worshiper,
even such a capacity as may enable him to perform that worship which God requires of him.
Now this is the thing to be inquired into: What is this capacity?
And who are the persons that are found in this capacity?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The worshiper in the times of the gospel, the worshiper under the new covenant,
is "`he that is born of God,`" he that is drawn out of the dark spirit of this world,
and formed anew in the light of God's Spirit.
The worshiper whom "`the Father seeks to worship him`" is the inward Jew,
he that has the uncircumcision of his heart cut off by the power of God.
This is the sort of worshipers God chose when he cast off the outward Jews.
God did not choose any one nation, or many nations, instead of the one which he cast off.
Rather, he sent his apostles and ministers among all nations to
gather a spiritual seed instead of the natural.
And this spiritual seed alone is capable of setting up
and holding forth his spiritual worship unto the world,
and to provoke them to wait for and press towards the capacity
of coming into the same spiritual worship with them.

[.discourse-part]
Question 2: Which is the place of worship?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
The only place of worship in the new covenant is
where the spiritual worshipers meet together.
This place is spiritual.
Even as the worship is spiritual, so is the place where it is to be offered.
It has a spiritual constitution; it is not outward, as under the law.
It is to be offered in the Spirit; that is the place.
Where does my soul offer its private worship to God?
Does it have relation to any outward place?
Or is it in the building which God has reared up in my heart by his Spirit?
This building stands in, and is comprehended in, his Spirit,
and I can offer his public worship in no other
place except in a building of the same nature,
in a house built of more of the same stones.

This then is the way of worshiping in the true Light:
various living stones meeting together,
every one retiring in spirit into the living name, into the power which begat them,
meeting in one and the same place, in one and the same power,
in one and the same fountain of Life.
Here they bow down to the Father of life, offering up living sacrifices to him,
and receiving the bread and water of life from him,
and feeding in the rich pastures of his infinite fullness.
In the holy city,
in the living temple which is built by God of the stone which all other builders refuse,
is the place of the worship of the living God,
where the true Jews meet to offer up their spirits, souls,
and bodies a living sacrifice to the Father of life.
Here they meet with such a glorious presence and power of the
Father as none but the true Jews were ever acquainted with.

[.discourse-part]
Question 3: What is the worship, or what are the sacrifices,
which the true worshipers offer up to God in this holy place?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The gifts that come from his Spirit.
These are offered up and nothing else.
The breathings which the Father gives into the heart of the child,
they are breathed back unto him in the same spirit of life, in the living sense,
in the quickening power.
Nothing of man's wisdom, nothing of man's invention, nothing according to man's will,
nothing that would please the flesh, or seem glorious in its eye, is offered up here.
But the exhortations, directions, or reproofs that spring up in God's light,
in God's wisdom, these are given forth in the leadings and by the guidance of his Spirit,
and they reach to the hearts of those to whom he pleases to direct them.
And this is the ground of such meltings, breakings,
and convictions of soul as are frequently found in such assemblies.
For the living God is there and the dread of his power overspreads
the hearts of such as are gathered into and assembled in his name.
The life springs up in the earthen vessels,
and the savor is precious to all that have their spiritual senses.

[.discourse-part]
Question 4: What is the season of offering up these gifts?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The seasons of the true worship stand in the will of God.
They are his gifts, and the time of them stands in the will of the Giver.
Prayer is a gift.
A man cannot pray whenever he desires;
but he is to watch and to wait when the Father will
kindle in him living breathings towards himself.
So too the word of God (whether of exhortation or instruction) is a gift,
which is to be waited for,
and then to be given forth in the life and strength of
that Spirit which caused it to spring.
Indeed it is a hard matter either to speak the word of the Lord,
or to hear the word of the Lord.
A man may easily speak what he invents,
and another may easily hear and judge of such words;
but to speak the word of life requires the tongue of
the learned in the language of God's Spirit.
And to hear the word of life requires a quickened ear.
And to know the times and seasons of the Spirit
requires both being begotten of the Spirit,
and being acquainted with it.

[.discourse-part]
Question 5: Was this the worship of the former Christians in the apostles' days?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Search the Scriptures.
Were they not come to the New Jerusalem?
And where did they offer their sacrifices?
Did they offer them in the Old Jerusalem, or at Samaria,
or the mountain where the fathers worshiped?
Or did they not rather offer them at the Mount Zion, to which they had come,
where the male of the flock (even the Lamb without spot) is known,
and the blood of sprinkling experienced? Heb. 12:22-24 and 1 Pet. 2:5.
Oh read!
Read in the life of God, the nature of the things themselves,
and do not feed upon your own imaginations,
or the imaginations of any other men concerning them.
Sweet is our God; his living presence is exceedingly nourishing to the soul.
Precious is his power felt in the heart;
it is no less than life eternal to worship him in his Spirit.
Oh let not the enemy of the soul cheat your souls any longer of the precious things
of his kingdom with husky and dry food which only gratifies the earthly part,
but nourishes not the immortal life!

[.discourse-part]
Question 6:
How did the worship of God come to be transformed and
changed so greatly from the living power,
into such dead, formal ways as generally worshipers in the world are found in?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The enemy has done this, by God's permission.
The Lord was pleased to allow him thus far to prevail against the truth;
even to get into the outward form of it, and there to beget men into the form,
and then deny and turn against the power.
And this is the way of antichrist in kingdoms and nations,
even to set up a formal way of worship, and by it to fight against the true power.

=== Some Questions and Answers Relating to Conversion, and to Tenderness of Conscience

[.discourse-part]
Question: What is the way of conversion?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: To turn men from darkness unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God.

[.discourse-part]
Question: When is a man converted?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: When he is gathered into the light and power,
out of the darkness of sin and dominions of Satan.

[.discourse-part]
Question: How is man converted?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By the operation of the light and power of God upon his conscience.

[.discourse-part]
Question: In what condition is the conscience before God works upon it?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Hard and corrupt;
hardened by selfish reasonings and dark imaginations against the
convictions of the light and operations of the power of God.
It is corrupted with the sin and iniquity that dwell in it.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What does God make it by his working upon it?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Gentle and tender, fit to receive the impressions of his Spirit.
By the influence and power of his Spirit on the conscience,
he opens the ear to hearken to his voice,
and prepares the heart to follow him in his leadings.

[.discourse-part]
Question: How does God carry on his work in the converted soul?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By keeping it low and tender,
out of the self-wisdom and hardening reasonings of the human understanding.
By this means he keeps the soul pliable to the light and power of his Spirit.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Is it only a tender conscience that is fit to be worked upon by God?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, indeed, that alone.
The heart that is hard is inconsiderate of the voice of
God and is stiff and stubborn against it.
It always has close at hand some wisdom or will of the flesh
with which to withstand the voice and leadings of God.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Who is it that preserves the conscience tender?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The Lord of the conscience.
He who made it knows the proper temper of it;
and his light and power are alone able to preserve it
in that tenderness in which he formed it.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What is it that hardens the conscience?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The wisdom of the flesh.
Man, having gained a wisdom outside of the light of God by the imaginations, reasonings,
and strength thereof, hardens himself against God.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
In what must a man be vigilant if he desires to have
the work of conversion continue in his heart?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: He must be careful to turn from and avoid the reasonings of man's wisdom,
and to have his eye and ear open to the light and voice of God's Spirit,
so that his conscience may be kept upright and clear before the Lord.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What stains the conscience?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Any disobedience to God's Spirit,
any hearkening to or following the voice of a strange spirit.
This lets in the darkness which defiles, even as the light cleanses.

Question:
Is a man then to expect such a thing as the leadings of God's Spirit in his conscience?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: A man cannot inherit the kingdom of God except he be born again,
even "`born of the Spirit.`"
So says the Scripture,
and so says the experience of everyone who experiences the new birth.
And when he is born of the Spirit, he is to abide with the Spirit,
and from him learn the law of the new life, and receive power from him daily.
If he does not, the spirit of darkness will soon get ground in him,
and by degrees recover him back again into his dominion.

Question: Surely if this be true, then hard is the way of true religion,
and there are but few who are found in the truth of it.

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The way of true religion is hard indeed,
and wholly contrary both to man's wisdom and will.
Indeed, man cannot enter into it, nor walk therein,
except as his wisdom and will are cut down.
He that will be a disciple of Christ and follow the
leadings of his Spirit must deny himself wholly,
and become another's, and be content to stand or fall to his own Master.
He cannot please men, no not in his worshiping of God;
but he must turn from that which is glorious in men's eyes,
and sacrifice to the Lord that which is to them an abomination. Ex. 8:26.
So that he who will be approved in the
sight of God must expect to be condemned by men.

Question:
Why has God put his people upon such hardship as still (in all
ages and generations) to walk in a way contrary to the world,
and to be the objects of its hatred, scorn, and persecution?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: How can it be otherwise,
since his people are begotten in a Spirit that is contrary to the world,
and which testifies against the world, showing that its deeds are evil?
How can the spirit of the world not turn against such as these,
and hate and persecute them?

[.discourse-part]
Question: How long shall it be this way?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
Until truth is raised by the power of God into
dominion over the spirit and power of darkness.
The Spirit of life now suffers under the burden of man's corruptions, in love to them,
striving to save them.
There is something in every sinner that at seasons groans under the weight of his sins,
and in some proportion strives against the burden thereof.
This shall not always lie underneath;
but in the day of the Lord it shall rise over the transgressor.
In that day Israel shall be glorious with his God, and receive praise of him,
and be eased of all that have oppressed him.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Will there be such a day?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The Scriptures testify of such a day,
wherein the Lord "`alone shall be exalted,`" and "`wherein he will take away
the rebuke of his people from off all the earth,`" and bring down "`all that
is high and lifted up`" above the fear and Spirit of the Lord.
And in this our age the Lord has chosen many messengers
to run up and down and proclaim this day.
And as sure as the Lord lives, what he has spoken shall come to pass,
and not a tittle of it fall to the ground.

God did not make man for him to serve his own lusts,
nor his creation to serve the lusts of man.
Rather he made man to fear before and serve his Creator;
and he made the creatures to be ordered by man in the
fear and wisdom of God to the glory of God.
The spirit of God now groans under man's iniquity;
the spirits of his people mourn and sigh also.
Indeed, the very creatures groan under the bondage of corruption;
and the God of compassion hears their cry.
A day, even a mighty day of redemption and deliverance is determined,
wherein the spirit of the world shall be sunk down with all its weight of wickedness,
and the Spirit of life and righteousness shall rise in its glory.
