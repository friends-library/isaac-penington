== Chapter IX. The New Covenant of the Gospel / Distinguished from the Old Covenant of the Law

=== Preface

There is no way to become an heir of the kingdom of
God except by being begotten and born of his Spirit,
which blows upon the spirit of man, breathes life into him,
and forms him in the eternal image.
John 3:8. Gal. 4:19.

There is no way of having this work of God preserved
in man except by turning to the Spirit who begets,
standing and keeping upright in that which is begotten,
and taking heed of the fleshly wisdom.
Man`'s wisdom stands near to corrupt and destroy the work of God,
tempting and leading aside from the truth itself into some image and resemblance of it.
And if this wisdom prevails, there is suddenly a departing from the living God,
and a running after the inventions of the fleshly wisdom (which appear in
the likeness of the true wisdom so that they might better deceive).

Now when man is first breathed upon and begotten towards God,
there is but a little life, a little simplicity, a little light, a little power,
a little of the wisdom of the true babe.
But there is also a great body of death, deceit, darkness, power,
and the wisdom of the flesh still standing.
All of these apply themselves to overturn and destroy
the true work of God by raising up a false image of it,
which is easily done.
But to abide and preserve oneself in the truth is difficult,
and is only maintained by that power which at first begat the life.

Now the power of God preserves the soul through keeping it out of the
sensual and reasoning part of man (where the corrupt one has his lodging),
and in that poor, low, little, childlike sensibility of the life,
which the Father has begotten.
Here is the entrance into the truth; here is the growth;
here is the preservation and safety.
And this is what makes it so hard for those that are wise and strong
in the reasoning and comprehending part either to enter in,
or to abide and grow in the nakedness, simplicity,
and seeming folly of the truth of the gospel.
Oh, what a great deal must be torn down before man can be truly reached and
convinced by the foolish and weak things which God uses to accomplish his
great works! 1 Cor. 1:27-28.
What a struggle God has with them to batter
their wisdom and bring down their understanding;
which the larger it is, the more it stands in the way of his light. 1 Cor. 1:19.
And how easily are those who have been convinced
drawn back into their own wisdom by some subtle device or other.
How quickly they are lured away from the plainness and singleness of the truth into
an attempt to hold it in the wisdom of the understanding part of man. 2 Cor. 11:3.

In the Spirit which begets, and in the truth which is begotten by it,
there is true unity.
Experiencing this in one another is that which unites us to one another.
When anyone keeps to this in his own person, he is kept to that which unites,
and that thing is kept alive in him which can be united.
However, departing from that,
there is a departing from the true unity into the error and ground of division.
And then,
that which has erred and departed from the true unity
always strives to set up a false image of unity,
and also casts blame on that which abides in the truth because it cannot thus unite.
For that which abides in the Spirit,
and in that which the Spirit has begotten and formed,
cannot unite according to the flesh.
That which has played the harlot and run from the Spirit unto an image
formed by the fleshly wisdom cannot unite according to the Spirit.
Consider this, O you professors of this age!
You blame us for departing from you; for withdrawing from unity with you.
But we blame you for departing from the living seed,
wherein alone our unity with you can stand.

Oh that you could hear the Lord`'s voice,
who cries aloud to the professors of this age to cease from man!
Cease from man in yourself,
O you who have ever had any taste of the pure grace and power of God!
Cease from your own understanding, your own affections, your own zeal,
your own gathered knowledge and wisdom from the Scriptures,
with all the sparks of your own kindling.
Let God be all in you, and let his eternal habitation be raised up in you and perfected,
and you swallowed up and comprehended in it forever.
Oh, what a work it is for God to drive man`'s reason and wisdom out of his temple,
out of his Scriptures, out of all his holy things!
He that has an ear let him hear, for the sake of his soul`'s eternal peace.
Alas! Alas!
How many stumble at and blaspheme that which alone can save the soul!

The Jews owned the Messiah (according to the Scriptures, as they thought),
but rejected him in the way he came to save them.
Now if Christians have gathered a kind of knowledge from the Scriptures as the Jews did,
how can they avoid the same error; namely,
of owning Christ according to the Scriptures (as they
think) but rejecting him as he comes to save them?
How can they avoid rebelling against his living ministry,
and the pure power and demonstration of his Spirit?
Will his power not appear weak and low,
because it does not appear the same as they expect,
according to their apprehensions of the Scriptures?
Thus reading the Scriptures in another spirit and wisdom than that which wrote them,
they will necessarily conclude and gather something other than what is written in them,
and use the letter as a means of erring from the life.

=== The Sabbath of the Lord

In true love to your souls, and in the fear of the Lord,
I have a few things to lay before you, so that the simplicity in you may not be deceived,
and that you do not err from the way of life.
For, if you are searching into Scripture with the wrong eye,
you will of necessity misread, misunderstand, and mis-practice;
and so you will be running still further and further from God,
even while you think you are drawing closer to him.
Be persuaded, therefore,
to seriously consider (in the childlike simplicity of his begetting,
where the true life springs) the following things.

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ That the whole law of Moses (the ten commandments,
as well as the institutions about sacrifices and
worship) was added because of transgression.
Gal. 3:19.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ That the whole law (the ten commandments,
as well as the sacrifices) was representations, figures, or shadows,
of something relating to Christ, the seed.
It was something inferior to the promise, not making perfect, but pointing to,
and making way for the bringing in of the better hope. Gal. 3:21. Heb. 7:19.
The law of the commandments did
no more make perfect than the other shadows or sacrifices did,
but with them a way was made for the better hope,
towards which they were to lead the disciple as schoolmaster.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ That the whole dispensation of the law was given to the Jews,
and not to the Gentiles. Rom. 9:4.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ That the duration of this dispensation of Moses`' law in the
letter was until Christ the seed should come and fulfill it. Gal. 3:19. and 24-25.
Moses`' house, with all the laws thereof,
was to prepare for Christ the seed, and to give way to him when he came.
For when that dispensation which was described by types and figures is come,
then the dispensation of figures is at an end. Heb. 3:5-6.
Christ came to do the will, to keep and fulfill the whole law,
and so to put an end to that dispensation of it. Psa. 40. Rom. 10:4.
And so he takes away the first administration of the law,
which was in the letter, that he might establish the second, which is in the Spirit.
Heb. 10:9. 2 Cor. 3:7-11.

====

This then is the truth as it is in Jesus concerning this thing:
That Christ coming in the flesh,
and fulfilling all the righteousness (in the ten commandments and the sacrifices),
puts an end to the former dispensation wholly; so that from now on,
both Jews and Gentiles are to come to him, to hear his voice;
"`This is my beloved Son, hear him.`"
Moses foretold that when that prophet came,
he was to be heard in all things, Duet. 18:15.
The whole ministration of Moses was but a figure and
symbol of what the Son was afterwards to fulfill in Spirit, Heb. 3:5.
Moses was faithful to give the entire shadow to his house,
the nation of the Jews,
but Christ would be faithful to give forth the
entire law and substance of life to his house, Heb. 3:6.
So that now in the gospel, Christ being come,
the new covenant and new law in the Spirit is in effect,
and not the old covenant or law in the letter.
And this new law is more inward, more full, more close, more spiritual, and more lasting,
than the ministration of Moses`' law was to them of old time.
Gal. 3:25. And it is the ministration of this law of the Spirit which is
not to pass away from the disciples of Christ until all be fulfilled;
but is to remain a sword against every lust and
desire of the flesh in them until they all,
with the very root of them, be thereby cut down.
Matt. 3:10-12. Heb. 4:12. Matt. 5:17-18.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But what were the ten commandments a figure or shadow of?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
The tablets of stone were representations or figures of the fleshly tablets of the heart,
wherein the new law of the covenant of life is written.
The writing of the law of commandments in the tablets of stone was a figure
of the writing of the new law by the finger of God`'s Spirit in the heart.
The outward writing in the outward tablets was a figure
of the inward writing in the inward tablets.

And when the new law is in this way received, in this way written,
it is easily fulfilled.
Whereas, the law in the letter, because of the weakness of the flesh,
was very hard to be fulfilled,
and generally proved a handwriting of ordinances against the Jews.
For he that was guilty of one, was guilty of all,
and so every transgression had the force and strength of the whole law against him.
And now, whosoever runs back to the law of the letter,
to take up any command as it was held forth in it,
so makes himself a debtor to the whole law.
And this one will be found a breaker of the law in spirit,
even one that has more gods than the Lord, a maker of images,
a taker of the name in vain, a profaner of the Sabbath, etc.
For he that has not received the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,
knows not the Lord of life to be the only true God, but makes images in his mind,
and takes his name in vain, not experiencing its living power.
Nor can such a one truly keep his Sabbath (ceasing from sin, forbearing his own works,
his own willing and running,
and entering into the rest of the gospel). For
there is but one day of rest holy to the Lord,
and all the sabbaths of the law were but signs of it,
having but a symbolic or representative holiness.
The true day of redemption which the Lord has made,
Ps. 118:24 (in which his redeemed rejoice and rest in him) has the true holiness.
This was it which came by Christ, the other came by Moses. John 1:17.
Moses`' house or children were to keep that
natural day (that was the day for the servants,
who were to be exercised under the shadows),
but the believers are to keep this day in the Spirit,
to enter into this rest by the faith, Heb. 4.
And they are to worship the Father in it, in the Spirit and in the truth,
on the mountain of his holiness, John 4:23, of which the other mountain, temple,
worship, and day were but a shadow.

Now the sum or substance of this law of the Spirit may outwardly be
signified in various short words that comprehend the whole of it;
such as love, or the fear of the Lord, or this,
"`You shall not lust,`" (in this way it was administered to Paul, Rom. 7) or,
"`You shall keep the Sabbath,`" or, "`Believe in the light, follow the light.`"
The observing of any one of these in the Spirit is the keeping of the law,
for every breach of the law is outside of the love, outside of the fear,
a lust of the fleshly spirit,
a transgression of the Sabbath (or spiritual rest of God) outside of the light,
and outside of the faith.
But if you will read this in the Spirit,
and come to the true righteousness of the faith (which is
received in the obedience of faith to the law of the Spirit),
you must come to the Word of faith, to which Paul directs us.
Rom. 10:6. By the hearing of this word is the justification,
and not by a bare believing that Christ`'s blood was shed.
For it is the _power_ of the blood which saves; which power is in the living word,
and it is felt and received in hearing, believing, and obeying that word,
thereby bringing the soul into unity and conformity with him, both in his death,
and in his resurrection and life.
This is the only way to life.
Be not deceived, there is not, nor ever was, any other.
Oh, wait on the Lord in his fear that it may be opened to you!

=== A Spiritual Covenant

The apostle Paul says that God had made them
"`able ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit.`" 2 Cor. 3:6.
After the dispensation of the law,
which was a shadow of good things to come; and after the dispensation of the prophets,
who foretold of better days and a better state to come,
it first pleased God to send the forerunner John the Baptist in the spirit
and power of Elijah to prepare the way for the King and his kingdom.
Then the King himself was sent, in the fullness of his Spirit,
to gather disciples to himself,
and to furnish them with a competent measure of the same Spirit.
These were to raise up a spiritual seed unto him,
in whom the King would set up his kingdom and dwelling.
He would walk and reign there,
causing his light to shine from there round about the earth, out from his holy city,
founded upon his holy hill of Zion.

Now the disciples or ministers whom he chose to raise up this holy
seed unto him were made fit and able to minister his new covenant.
Indeed, he furnished them with such a power of his Spirit that
they were able through him to minister,
not in the letter, as the old covenant was ministered (which left the people still dead;
or rather, because of the transgressing nature, made the offense abound,
and so increased death upon them), but in the quickening Spirit.
This Spirit raises from death, and brings into the light of the living,
to walk with the living God towards the land of eternal rest and peace.
Therefore, that which they ministered was Spirit,
and that which they ministered to was spiritual.
By the power of the Spirit, in preaching the living Word of faith,
they reached through the veil to that which lay in death.
They stirred up a living seed, and ministered life to it through the Spirit.
Gal. 3:5. And those who were born of this living seed,
they taught to live in the Spirit, to walk in the Spirit,
to be made perfect by the Spirit,
and not to run back to the ministration of the letter (as was
common for the Jews in their day). They were taught not to run
back to the manner of the former dispensation,
but to abide in the living seed, to grow up in the seed,
into the eternal life and immortality of the gospel.

Mark well (O you Christians who desire eternal life) the
different way of ministration between the law and the gospel!
The law was a ministration of the letter,
in which they were to look for assistance from the Spirit by
which they might be kept in the faith of the law,
and made obedient to it. Neh. 9:20.
The gospel is a ministration of the Spirit,
wherein they are to begin with the Spirit, and to go on with the Spirit.
They are not to gather outward rules from the letter, from what is written or spoken,
but to keep to the living seed and experience refreshment in that,
in reading or hearing what is written or spoken by the Spirit.
And in this way, when the Scriptures are read, or when one speaking from God is heard,
it is mingled with faith, and becomes profitable, feeding and refreshing the young,
tender plant, the living seed, and causing it to grow up into him.
However, whatever is understood, or received, or held to outside of the Spirit,
feeds but the earthly part, and only thickens the veil over the living seed.

"`The kingdom of heaven is at hand,`" said John the Baptist. Matt. 3:2.
"`It is come unto you,`" said Christ, Matt. 12:28,
speaking of that power of life which was made
manifest in him to the Pharisees. Luke 17:21.
The Pharisees demanded of him when the kingdom of God should come.
It comes not, says he, with outward show or observation.
It comes not the way you look for it, that is,
by the manifestation of an outward glorious king to reign
outwardly in the commonwealth of the outward Israel.
The kingdom is within you.
How was it within them?
Christ explains to them in another place; it was in them like a grain of mustard seed;
it was the least of all the seeds in their hearts.
There were many great seeds of darkness there,
but yet there was also one little seed of light.
It was there along with the others (though smaller than them all),
and did sometimes cast some glimmerings of light,
though the darkness could not comprehend it.
This seed was also compared to leaven,
which being received by faith into the lump would leaven the whole lump,
and bring it into the savor and domination of the kingdom.
Now the ministry of the apostles was to turn men from Satan`'s kingdom to this kingdom;
from his large compass of dominion in the heart, to this narrow seed;
from his great territories of darkness, to this little seed of light;
from his great power of death, to this little,
weak thing of God wherein the eternal power and godhead is made manifest.
And all of this comes to be opened and increased by the Spirit.
Here light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart;
where it is to grow up,
and from where the harvest will be reaped after its growth to perfection.

Oh, how long have Christians (so called) lacked the Spirit!
How have they wearied themselves in running to and fro
throughout the letter to find the mind of God,
yet are still unsatisfied concerning it,
even drowned in fleshly imaginations and arguments about it!
They seek to have that part satisfied which is not to be satisfied.
They seek to have that part know which is not to know.
They offer to God the service, faith, and obedience of that which he will not accept,
and they keep that from him which he calls for.
They seek for the Spirit in the letter, according to the manner of the law,
but they do not wait to experience it in the seed, the life-giving seed,
dwelling in the seed, where Christ and his apostles directed us to wait for it.
They look in written words for the knowledge, faith, life, and Spirit,
which the apostle preached was to be sought from the Word in the heart.
And by this means they raise up several buildings, and get various kinds of knowledge,
each according to his own understanding and apprehension of the letter,
and each man is very confident concerning his own apprehensions that they are right.
In this way they wander from the city of the living God, and from the living knowledge,
to build up images (some outwardly, some in their minds, some more gross,
some more refined) lacking the true life and power of God.

Oh that you could read in the eternal light of life!
O Christians, Christians!
Oh that you could see how your understanding and knowledge from the letter
stands as much in your way as ever the Jews`' knowledge did in theirs.
This must be broken down as flat as ever theirs was,
before the foundation of the kingdom can be laid and
the building of eternal life reared up in your hearts!
Be not offended at my zeal for the Lord my God, and for your souls.
It has cost me very dear what I testify to you
in the simplicity and integrity of my heart.
And this I know to be most certainly true,
that that spirit of man which has nestled itself in the letter without the eternal light,
and found a kind of wisdom and knowledge there, will be shaken and driven out,
even by that very Spirit which gave forth the letter.
And when this is done, and God`'s Spirit at last opens the letter,
oh how sweet and profitable it will be, being read in the light of the Spirit!
Oh how clear and refreshing to read in the faith which is in Christ Jesus,
which is begotten in the heart by the word of faith!
From that light, from that spring (as the Lord is pleased to open, enlarge,
and fill the vessel), all the words of the holy men of God came;
and in that light alone they have their sweetness, freshness, virtue, and fullness.
But we must read these words outwardly written while keeping to that light,
and understanding them in that spring!
And we must keep out the natural man, with his natural understanding,
which knows not the things of the Spirit,
nor can know or receive them! 1 Cor. 2:14.
This is a mystery to those who have not been turned inward to this word,
nor have known or heard his voice.
But the Lord is recovering the mystery of life, and as that appears,
the mystery of death, under all its paint (under all its painted faith, painted love,
painted knowledge, painted obedience, painted duties, ordinances, and worship),
will be made manifest.
Happy is he whose inward building will stand,
whose gold will abide the fire and everlasting burnings of the jealous God,
and whose eye-salve was bought of the true Spirit.
But how hard will it be for the man whom the Lord (when he
comes to search him) does not find to be a true inward Jew,
nor truly circumcised by the Lord`'s eternal Spirit and light.

This is the great misery of Christians: that the veil lies over their hearts,
even the same veil which covered the letter of Moses from the Jews.
And these are groping after the mind of God in the letter,
but the life is hidden from them, even as it was from the Jews.
And because they also say they can see, and that they have the life and the Spirit,
therefore the veil remains, and they remain yet in captivity and bondage to the enemy.

=== Some Questions and Answers

[.discourse-part]
Question:
Are not the ten commandments expressed in Exodus 20 moral and therefore perpetual?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
The covenant which God made with the Jews at Mount Horeb when
they came out of the land of Egypt was not to be perpetual,
but was to make way for that covenant, priesthood, lawgiver, and law,
which were to be perpetual.
The law given to Moses made nothing perfect,
but was a continual handwriting of ordinances against the Jews.

Now this former covenant was not to abide, but to give place to the other
(see Heb. 8, which speaks of the new covenant).
For God`'s speaking of a new
covenant implies that he himself has made the first old. 8:13.
The first had a long continuance among that people of the Jews; but now,
in view of the coming of Christ, who was to be Mediator of a better covenant, 8:6,
even a new covenant, 8:8, that which had been long decaying and waxing old,
was now ready to vanish away. 8:13.

Indeed it was necessary that it should pass away, for it was not faultless.
How was it not faultless?
Was there any sin in the holy law and ministration of God by Moses?
Can any blame be found in anything that proceeded from the Lord?
Indeed the ministration of Moses was holy and without blame,
but it was weak because of the flesh.
Rom. 8:3. Therefore,
God desired to lay it aside (for it was weak and
suited to the weakness of a fleshly people),
and to bring in instead a ministration of the law in the Spirit,
which would be living and powerful and effectual in the spirits of his people.

Now God`'s aim in a covenant was to keep himself and his people together.
But this first covenant was weak on the people`'s part; they did not continue in it,
and so, according to that covenant, God disregarded them. ver. 9.
Finding this covenant not able to effect his purpose of love towards his people,
God finds fault with it, bringing forth another,
or second, to which the first gives way. ver. 7.
And this other covenant, or new covenant, is not according to the old.
In what sense was it not according to the old?
Why in this: it was not written outwardly, as the first was.
"`Not according to that which I made with their fathers,
when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.`" ver. 9.
"`For I will put my laws in their mind, and write them in their hearts.`" ver. 10.
And here they shall learn the knowledge of God,
everyone from the least to the greatest, ver. 11.
"`So that all the children of this covenant shall be taught of the Lord,`"
and learn the law from his mouth.
This is not according to how the law was given at Mount Sinai
(which ministration was to the children of the old covenant),
but as the law goes forth out of Zion,
and from the "`Jerusalem which is above,`" which is the
mother of all the children of the new covenant.

Observe therefore diligently the following few things in the fear of the Lord:

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
_First:_ The ten commandments given by Moses from Mount Horeb were the
covenant which God made with the Jews when he took them by the
hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.

[.numbered]
_Secondly:_ That covenant God found fault with because it was not able
(through the weakness of the flesh on their parts)
to keep them to God.

[.numbered]
_Thirdly:_ In Christ`'s coming God provides a new covenant,
a better covenant, of which Christ is the mediator.
This covenant was not outward, like the former, but inward, put in the mind,
written in the heart.
As the people are inward, the sanctuary inward, the ark inward,
the tablets of the covenant inward, so the covenant itself, and the writing of it,
are inward also.
And this covenant, as it is only written in the Spirit, and in that which is spiritual,
so it cannot be read in the letter.

[.numbered]
_Fourthly:_ That wherever this new covenant comes, the other waxes old,
whether to a person or to a people.
Wherever the law of the Spirit of life is made manifest,
the law of the letter is swallowed up in it,
and is known no more except as it is comprehended and is brought forth in it.
And he that is in the Spirit, and has received the law of life from the Spirit,
knows not Christ after the flesh, and much less Moses.
But the whole ministration of Moses in the Spirit (not only the ten
commandments but all the sacrifices and other types also) is here
acknowledged and received even in Christ the substance.
But the ten commandments, so far as they were a shadow,
pass away before the Sun of righteousness,
as well as the other types and shadows of the law.

====

[.discourse-part]
Objection: But was there anything in the ten commandments that was a shadow?
Do they not all command abiding things?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
Moses`' ministration (as it stood in the letter without) was but a
shadow of the fullness and perfection of that ministry of the Spirit
which was to come and be set up by the Son in his house. Heb. 3:5-6.
Moses`' people were but a shadow of the spiritual people.
Moses`' priests and sacrifices were but a shadow of the spiritual priests and sacrifices.
Moses`' law in the letter ministered from Mount Sinai was but a shadow
of Christ`'s law in the Spirit to be ministered from Mount Zion. 2 Cor. 3:10-11.
The law itself which was given by Moses was but a
shadow of the grace and truth which came by Jesus Christ. John 1:17.
Now, look particularly on the ten commandments,
and see if there will not appear something of a shadow in them.

The first commandment to that people is,
"`That they should have no other gods (like the heathen) but
him only whose powerful arm had brought them out of Egypt.`"
This is a shadow of an inward subjection of spiritual Israel to the Lord of spirits,
who by his mighty arm redeemed them out of spiritual Egypt.

The second commandment,
"`That they should not make any images or likenesses of things in heaven or earth,
or bow down to them,`" is this not a shadow of what God
requires of spiritual Israel in the inward man?
The carved images and outward idols speak of all likenesses, inventions, imitations,
imaginations, and resemblances of what man has seen in the Spirit above,
or observed beneath in the earthly nature.
These they must not make for themselves, nor bow to those that others have made.

And that they must not "`take the name of the Lord in
vain,`" was this not a shadow of man`'s claims to the living
power of God when God is not himself manifest in them?
Does man not now pretend to meet in the living name, and to worship in the Spirit,
when they in fact have played the harlot and run from it, and are now strangers to it?
Should I mention any more?
It is easy to observe how the other commandments were outward shadows of the
inward innocency and purity which the believer receives inwardly,
into his heart, from the powerful operation of the law of the Spirit of life in him.

[.discourse-part]
Objection: But are we now permitted to break these laws?
If they may not be broken, then they are perpetual.

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
The reason why they may not be broken is not because
the dispensation of them is still in force,
but because the dispensation of the law of the Spirit
comprehends and fulfills all the righteousness of Moses`' law.
Christ`'s dissolving that covenant was not so that anyone might
have liberty to do the things shown to be unrighteous,
but rather that the righteousness described in the law might be
fulfilled in them who receive the law of the Spirit of life.
Rom. 8:4. And mark this diligently:
the law of sin is nearer to us than any law of the letter can come.
The covenant of death and hell is written within by the finger of Satan.
Therefore, that which blots this out must be just as near, even an inward covenant,
an inward writing from the eternal Word in the heart,
by the law of his eternal Spirit of life.

This then is my answer:
Moses`' law in substance remains as it is taken in by Christ,
and administered by him in Spirit.
But it does not remain as it was given in the letter to the Jews;
for in that form it was a shadow, making nothing perfect.
The covenant of the letter made way for the better hope,
for the covenant established upon better promises,
for the inward law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.
This indeed affects the spirits of God`'s people, which Moses`' law could by no means do.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But what is the substance of the law which abides?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The substance of the law is love: to love God above all (above all without,
above all within), and to love one`'s neighbor as one`'s self.
To receive this love from God, and to bring it forth in his Spirit,
this is the substance of the law; this is the thing which the law pointed at in a shadow.
The law is fulfilled in this one word love;
but that love must be received from God who fulfills the law.
A man may strive to love abundantly, and strive to obey in love,
and yet fall short of the covenant,
because the Lord must first circumcise the heart before
that love can spring up which fulfills the law. Duet. 30:6.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Is not the purpose of the fourth commandment,
"`Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,`" to persuade us to lay aside
the work of our employment one day out of seven,
that we may on that day be wholly given up to wait upon the Lord?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
The scope and purpose of the fourth commandment was to
enjoin the Jews to keep the Sabbath strictly as a sign,
by forbearing all works,
and sanctifying it as a day of rest to the Lord according to the law. Ezek. 20:12.
But the substance being come (Christ, who is the body, Col. 2:17),
and the day and rest of the Spirit being known, the sign comes to an end,
and the substance takes its place.
So that the rest is now in Christ, through faith, by his Spirit,
where the worship is also.
And this in the gospel comprehends the time of worship, the place of worship,
and the worship itself (which are spiritual). Here, in Christ the substance,
all is known, enjoyed, and celebrated,
which was only testified to in shadows under the law.
The sanctification being come, the rest being come, the Lord of the Sabbath being come,
shall not the sign of the sanctification, the sign of the rest pass away? Ex. 31:13.

Question: Our Lord says, (Matt. 5:18) "`Till heaven and earth pass,
one jot or tittle should in no way pass from the law.`"
If he here means not the law of the ten commandments, then what law did he mean?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By the law is meant the whole ministration of Moses; and by the prophets (ver. 17)
is meant the whole ministration of the prophets.
So that Christ does not only include the ten commandments,
but also the fullness of Moses`' ministry,
and says that not one jot or tittle was to pass till it be all fulfilled; that is,
it was to stand firm in the letter to the Jews till full season.

"`The law and the prophets were until John,`" and from
that time the kingdom of God began to be preached.
Luke 16:16. Then both the law, prophets, and John himself were to decrease,
and Christ and his kingdom were to increase.
Christ, in this fifth chapter of Matthew,
had been preaching the kingdom and declaring to whom it belonged.
Now this manner of preaching might have seemed to
deviate from the law of Moses and from the prophets,
whose doctrine and dispensation hereby Christ might seem to destroy.
But he removes the occasion of such a misapprehension by bidding them
not to think he came to destroy the law or the prophets;
for he had not come to destroy, but to fulfill.
Therefore, we find that Christ does these two things:

_First,_ He establishes that ministration of the law and prophets for its season,
till it should be fulfilled by him the substance,
who was to fulfill all the righteousness of it.
It should last out its whole day,
and should not fail in the least tittle of it (as he himself explains, Luke 16:17);
till the heaven and earth of the Jews passed away. Heb. 12:27-28.

_Second,_ He takes the substance of it into his own ministration,
and lays it more inwardly, and closely, and largely, upon the spirits of his disciples,
than Moses had done in the letter upon his disciples.
Here in Matthew he does not explain it fully,
but gives a taste to his disciples how directly he would
minister it to them by his Spirit as they came under his yoke,
Matt. 11:29, which yoke is the Spirit of the law thereof,
as Moses`' yoke was the law of the letter.

Now mark even further: Christ does not give out a letter for his law,
as it was delivered by Moses,
but requires something of his disciples which comprehends the letter.
For instance, when he administers the law against revenge, from whence murder proceeds,
he does not say, "`You shall not kill,`" as Moses had said to them of old time.
Rather he says, You shall not be angry without a cause,
nor give your brother any provoking language.
Matt. 5:22. Nor does he say, "`You shall not commit adultery;`" but,
You shall not look with lust, nor let in a lustful thought. ver. 28.

And had Christ spoken here about the Sabbath,
would he have administered it in the letter?
Or would he have commanded the observation of the true Sabbath, where no work is done,
no fire kindled, nor any burden borne; but rather every creature rests in the seed?
"`The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.`"
It is true he subjected himself under the law; but yet he was still Lord;
and he makes all to be his, kings and priests to God,
who being once baptized into his death, know also his resurrection and reign.

Question: If the coming of Christ in the flesh,
and his fulfilling all the righteousness of the law,
put an end to the law in the letter and gave forth another law to Christ`'s house,
what then is this new law?
And is it contrary to the written law?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: It is the law of the Spirit, or the light of the Spirit in the heart,
which discovers sin (not only in the outward acts, but in its source, rise,
first motions, and inward nature), giving forth his living commands against it.
This now is the law in which the believer is to begin, Gal. 3:3,
and according to which he is to go on to perfection.
For as the believer is begotten of the Spirit, and born of the Spirit,
so he is to receive the ministration of his law from the Spirit, and in the Spirit.
He receives a gift of faith, a measure of faith from the eternal spring of life,
and that is his law.
His law is the law of faith.
The light of life, which he receives in the faith,
opens the mind and will of Christ to him in the Spirit, showing him both sin,
and also the things of God more fully than the law of Moses could.
This is a fuller, deeper kind of ministration,
and so it opens the things which it ministers more
fully than the ministration of an inferior nature could.
Yet it is not contrary to Moses`' law, but gathers into itself all the substance,
righteousness and equity of it (as I said before), which the law, as a shadow,
represented, and was commanded to that outward or shadowy people, the Jews.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Why then does the apostle James speak of transgressing the royal law,
and admonish to "`So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty?`"

[.discourse-part]
Answer: What is the royal law?
What is the law of liberty?
Was the law administered by Moses the royal law?
Or is the royal law that which is administered by the Son, who is the King of saints,
and who writes his law in their hearts, as their King?
Again,
was the law which Moses administered to the Jews a law of liberty or a law of bondage?
Did not the ministration on Mount Sinai lead to bondage? Gal. 4:24.
But in the ministration of the law by the Spirit there is life and liberty,
ver. 26. and 2 Cor. 3:17.
And this very law, "`You shall love your neighbor as yourself,`"
is royal, and is a law of pure liberty,
and there is no bondage when it is administered by the Spirit.
But let any man read this law in the letter and strive to obey it to the utmost he can,
he shall find it weak because of the flesh, and also accusing and enslaving him.

And this is the reason that Christians so mourn in their prayers,
even as persons in bonds: because they do not know the royal law of liberty.
They do not feel the love which the Spirit begets,
but rather they strive to get the written letter into their hearts,
seeking to answer the commands of the letter with
whatever love and obedience they can muster.
And this (through not seeing the true covenant and
ministry of Christ) they call obeying in the Spirit.
The testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy. Rev. 19:10.
His commandments come fresh from that Spirit of prophecy,
and we are to take heed of them until the day dawns and the daystar arises.
Then we will know a fuller ministration than that of prophecy,
even the shining and appearing of that thing which was prophesied.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Is not the fourth command, to keep the Sabbath, to be kept by all believers?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: All the commands of Christ`'s covenant are to be kept by believers,
according as he dispenses them under his administration in the new covenant.
But the laws of the old covenant are not the laws of the new covenant,
except in that they are gathered up and comprehended in the
righteousness which is taught and required by the Spirit,
which is fuller, stricter, and more exact than that which the law of Moses required.

I do not hereby go about to teach any to break the least of Christ`'s commands,
but rather the way to fulfill them, which is this:
to know and obey them under the ministry of his own covenant,
wherein he writes them in the heart and mind by his Spirit.
In this way the keeping of all Christ`'s commands is possible.
Yes, this is the _only_ way to have the righteousness of the law fulfilled in us.
For he that keeps the eye which the Spirit has opened fixed upon the Spirit,
this one shall not be able to break any law of righteousness,
but rather the righteousness even of Moses`' law shall be fulfilled in him.

Christ is the true rest of the gospel (as he is also the holy land),
and by believing we enter into this rest.
This is the true Sabbath, and the way to keep it.
Keeping in the faith, the gospel rest is kept.
Parting with every lust that he makes manifest,
observing everything that this King calls for by his Spirit,
and waiting for the further manifestation or
shining of the light of his Spirit in the heart,
this is the true obedience of the faith.
This is the holy and spiritual life and subjection of the living soul to its living King.
This is the beginning of a true Christian, his growth, and his perfection.
But as for times, places, persons, etc.,
these are of another nature and belong to another part,
even to that part in man which is to be done away as he
comes into the faith and into the rest.

With faith I do not make void the law,
but rather establish it in its ministration in the Spirit to the disciples of Christ.
Those keeping to the Spirit cannot transgress the righteousness of the law,
though they may learn by the Spirit not to esteem one day above another,
but rather to esteem every day the same,
(no days ever having had any real holiness in them one above another;
but only in a figurative or representative sense, which the substance, Christ,
swallows up). For as Christ`'s day dawns,
those things which were the shadows of it fly away.

Objection: Is it not dangerous to hold forth a spiritual Sabbath,
and to deny the weekly Sabbath wherein our Lord Jesus Christ rested,
which also the Lord blessed and sanctified to Adam and his posterity?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The gospel is a state of substance,
a state of fulfilling the types and shadows of the law by bringing
believers into the possession of that which was signified.
Canaan was a type of Christ, who is the land of the living,
in whom every believer has a present habitation according to the proportion of his faith.
Now the Sabbath is the day of rest which every believer
is to celebrate to Christ in this holy land,
which he does by believing and obeying his Spirit in the faith,
which keeps him out of sin, unbelief, and unrest.
But the idea that the Sabbath of the law,
and the rest thereof which pointed to the faith,
is still to be held up in the time of the gospel, I know no scripture which teaches this.
And I know something which teaches me otherwise.
The day is dawned, blessed be the Lord God Almighty; the everlasting day is dawned,
and the shadows of the law are flown away.

[.discourse-part]
Objection: Does not Heb. 4 speak of three rests: the seventh day,
Israel`'s rest in Canaan, and a remaining rest, of which David speaks? Psa. 95.

[.discourse-part]
Answer: I grant it; there were two rests under the law,
which were signs of the one rest under the gospel.
The two under the law were outward and natural,
the one under the gospel inward and spiritual, consistent with the state of the gospel.
David was not only acquainted with the state of the law,
but with the Spirit and the eternal law in the Spirit.
He knew the new creation, the creating of a new spirit, and also the new rest.
He knew the circumcision of the heart,
the spiritual sacrifices of a broken heart and of praise.
He could take the cup of salvation, and sing the song of praise to the Lord,
which none can do in the strange land, nor on any other day but the day of rest.
And he invites Israel to this rest, that they might not harden their hearts against it;
but in the day of their visitation enter into it,
by hearkening to the Word which was nigh them,
which gives the entrance through the faith.
"`Today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,`" etc.

There is a rest you are now called to enter into,
as your fathers were called to enter into the land of Canaan.
Therefore, harden not your hearts as they did; but hear the voice,
hear the word which calls to this rest, believe and enter.
This rest remains, says the apostle;
the others were types of it under the state of the law, which was to pass away.

Now, the entrance into the fullness of rest is not immediate;
but he has a long journey to take from Egypt, the dark land; from Sodom, the filthy land;
from Babylon, where all the vessels and holy things of God have been defiled,
through the wilderness unto Canaan.
Many battles are to be fought with enemies by the way,
and also with the enemies which possess the holy land.
Many hardships are to be undergone in following the Captain,
who also leads his Israel by a pillar of cloud by day and by a pillar of fire by night.
And there must be a circumcision and baptism in the cloud and in the sea,
and the falling of all those carcasses in the wilderness which are not to enter,
nor so much as see the good land,
before the entrance be ministered to the seed and to that
which passes through the water and fire with the seed.
In plain terms,
there must be a taking up of the yoke and a learning of Christ under the yoke,
until the proud, stiff, stubborn, wise, willful, and selfish spirit, and the hard,
stony heart, be wasted and worn out by the cross.
Nothing must be left except what becomes one with the seed,
and so is fit to be married to it, and to enter with it into the everlasting kingdom.

Now this bearing the yoke, this taking up of the cross,
this following of Christ in the wilderness, through the corrections of the Father,
through the buffetings and temptations of the enemy,
in the midst of all the weaknesses and frailties of the flesh, going when he bids go,
standing still where he stops, fighting when he prepares for the warfare,
bearing the reproach when he suffers the enemy to prevail, and hoping, even beyond hope,
for his relief and victory in due season: _this_ is the labor, the travail,
the working under the life, with the measure of grace and power received from the life.
So that first, the dayspring from on high visits,
and from that visitation there is light entered into the heart,
and by agreeing with that light there is grace received.
And making use of this grace received there is work to be done for God;
for his talent is to be improved all the six days by
those who will rest with him on the seventh,
and by all who desire to cease from their labors in the fruition of the faith, life,
power (his power living, becoming,
and performing all things in them). And he that does not improve the talent,
or follow on in the pure light, but either sits down by the way,
or is deceived with an image of what once was true in him,
this one can never arrive at the land of rest.
And when the eternal witness awakes in him, he will find the lack of it,
and will bitterly bewail his grievous mistake.

Question: What does the new covenant, or covenant of the gospel, contain?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: God putting his fear in the heart, writing his laws in the mind,
pouring out pure,
clear water upon them to wash away the pollutions of their inward parts,
circumcising the filth of the heart,
healing the backsliding nature by creating a right spirit within,
and keeping the created spirit right by the presence of that Spirit which created it.
(See Jer. 31:31-32, Ezek. 36:25, and Hosea 14:4)
This is God`'s covenant,
this is the new covenant which is to be made with the
house of Israel and Judah when God redeems them;
and they can never be redeemed except by this covenant.
Israel was to remain desolate until the Spirit be poured out from on high upon them,
Isa. 32:15, until their hearts be circumcised to love the Lord their God,
until his fear be placed there, and they thereby made to walk in his ways.
But when they receive the Spirit, and are brought into the fear,
and have the law written on their hearts and become subject to it,
so they will taste of this covenant, be brought to redemption by it,
and become a glory inwardly and outwardly upon the earth.

Now consider: Whether that people the Jews,
as they stood related to God in their covenant (given by Moses at Mount Horeb),
together with the covenant itself, and all things pertaining to it,
were not a shadow of inward and spiritual things
afterwards to appear and be made manifest in its season.
Whether they themselves were not a shadow of a more inward and spiritual people,
to be gathered to God by the inward and spiritual covenant.
Whether their outward covenant was not a shadow
or visible representation of that covenant,
and the laws of it a shadow or representation of the inward laws,
which were to be written in the hearts of that spiritual people?
Was not their tabernacle, or temple, a shadow of the true tabernacle, or temple;
seeing God dwells not in temples made with hands, but in a poor, humble, contrite spirit,
and in the heart that trembles at his word?
Isa. 57:15 and 66:1-2. Was not their circumcision a shadow of the
circumcision which is to pass upon the hearts of God`'s chosen?
Were not their sacrifices types, or representations,
of the sacrifices of praise and of a broken heart?
Ps. 51:17 and 50:14. Was not their Canaan, or holy land, a type of the true, holy,
spiritual rest, into which faith gives entrance?
Was not their city Jerusalem a type of the Jehovah-shamma?^
footnote:[Meaning, "`The Lord is there.`" Ezekiel 48:35]
Were not their priests and Levites types of the spiritual priesthood,
which was to offer the pure offering and spiritual sacrifices among the Gentiles?
Malachi 1:11. And does their Scripture not
plainly foretell the casting off of the Jews,
with the rejecting of their offerings, priests, and Levites,
and God`'s raising up a seed among the Gentiles,
where he would have a more acceptable people and worship, even a pure, spiritual people,
and a pure, spiritual offering?

Secondly consider: If they were indeed types, representations,
or shadows of something spiritual to come,
then were they not to give way to that which is spiritual when it came,
and so to be swallowed up in it?
Is not the spiritual glory the true glory?
Is not the inward Jew the true Jew?
The circumcision of the heart the choice circumcision?
The offering up of praise and of a broken heart the acceptable sacrifice?
The land of life and righteousness the true land of rest to the living by faith?
Is not the spiritual city, house, or temple which God builds,
the Jerusalem or temple of the new covenant?
Is this not the chosen house to God?
And was not this spiritual glory to be expected in the days of the Messiah,
and all the types and shadows of Moses, which pointed at him, to end in him,
when once he came to set up his true, inward, invisible,
substantial glory among his inward and spiritual people?
When the day of Messiah dawns, shall not Moses`' shadows fly away?
Oh that your eyes were opened to behold the inward glory of life,
the good things of the new covenant,
the great treasure and riches which are revealed and possessed
in the Spirit by the spirits that are redeemed unto God!
Then your eye would not be so much on that which is outward; which,
if you possessed even to the utmost of your desire,
would not be comparable to the inward!

Lastly consider: When Moses gave the law, the veil was over his face,
and the fathers were not able to bear the light wherein the law was given,
nor the light wherein the prophecies of the prophets were given.
Therefore they erred from the law, were offended at the prophets while they were alive,
and misunderstood their words after their death.
Now are you not also searching into Moses and the prophets in
the same spirit of error as your fathers did,
being shut out from the light of them, even as they were?
If this is true, if the veil remains over your hearts,
if you are ignorant of the true light,
of the true eternal power wherein the Scriptures were given forth,
how can you not misunderstand them, misunderstand Moses, misunderstand the prophets,
misunderstand the things spoken concerning the Messiah?
Without this light you cannot see the end of those things ministered by Moses,
that ministration which was to pass away;
nor can you see the beginning of the ministration of the Messiah,
which was to succeed it.
Oh, turn within to the word nigh in the heart,
that the true Jew may be begotten and formed in you,
and his light may arise and overspread you!
In that light you will see the light of Moses, and the light of the prophets,
and not gather false meanings from their words,
but understand them aright in the same holy Spirit.
In that light you will enjoy the blessedness they spoke of and directed to,
which lies in the inward raising up of an inward seed,
and not in an outward conformity of the outward man,
while the heart and mind remains unchanged and unrenewed.
