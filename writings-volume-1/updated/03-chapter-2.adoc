== Chapter II. The Way of Life and Death Made Manifest and Set Before Men

=== Preface

Be wise, O you wise ones!
Be religious, O you religious ones!
Open the eye and ear that have been shut; shut the eye and ear that have been open.
Stumble no longer, lest you fall and rise no more.
I know you cannot see, for the wrong eye is open,
and the Lord has designed to hide his wisdom from that eye.
Become poor in spirit,
lest at last you prove to be the rich man whom the Lord will send away empty.
Sell all quickly, that you may have what is needed to buy the pearl.
You have not known the appearance of the Lord, but in your wisdom you have disdained it.
The children, the fools, the blind, can see the way, and enter into life.
But you that are men, that are wise, that have both your eyes,
that can judge in religion, and determine what is orthodox, and what is erroneous,
you cannot.

Oh hear, that your souls may live!
You know not how short your time is.
The day of your visitation passes away faster than you are aware.
The cry has long gone forth, Behold, the bridegroom comes,
and his spouse has been preparing for his bed!
You must put off your old garments, and put on the new.
You must have the true oil in your lamps,
or the door of the kingdom will be shut upon you, and there will be no entrance for you.
In plain terms,
you must part with all your religion which you have gathered in your own wisdom,
which has grown up in the apostasy,^
footnote:[Penington and many of his contemporaries used the word _apostasy_ to
refer to the condition of the church from the period of time beginning
shortly after the first apostles until the time of these writings.
In their mind, the predominantly dead, external,
and man-centered form of Christian religion that had spread
and prevailed over the centuries was the great falling-away,
or apostasy, that had been foretold by Christ and the apostles.]
and which only can make a fair show in the dark,
but cannot endure the searching light of the day of the Lord.
You must lay hold of the true religion, the true righteousness,
the true innocence and purity of Christ.
The old must be done away, truly done away, and the new must come in its place.
The flesh and self must be quite destroyed, and nothing but Christ found in you,
and you found nowhere but in Christ, if you are to enter into his kingdom;
for no unclean thing can enter.

Therefore put away pride and passion and enmity and fleshly reasonings.
Seek out that which is pure, and enter into it,
taking up the cross against all that is contrary.
And turn from all imaginings and conceivings about the
meanings of Scriptures in the uncertain and erring mind,
and come to that which is infallible.
Know the silencing of the fleshly part, that the spiritual part may grow in the wisdom,
and learn in the Spirit, and know the word of God, and be able to speak it.

My heart is towards you, and from it this has been written,
not to anger or shame you,
but to provoke you to jealousy against that dark and evil spirit which leads
you to destruction under the guise and appearance of light.
My desire is not to glory over you;
for my soul lies down in shame and sorrow before the Lord,
and the reproach of my own apostasy,
and my seeking relief from the world (turning from the Lord, who had wounded me,
to earthly vanities for comfort), will not easily be recovered.

The Lord had been kind to me in breaking me in my religion,
and in visiting me with sweet and precious light from his own Spirit; but I knew it not.
I felt, and could not but acknowledge his power upon me,
and I might have known what it was by allowing it to purify my heart,
and beget me into the image of God.
But I demanded this power to appear in a way of
demonstration to my reason and earthly wisdom,
and for lack of satisfaction therein, I denied and rebelled against it.
And so, after all my former misery, I lost my entrance,
and sowed seeds of new misery and sorrow to my own soul, which since I have reaped.

So now I have no cause to boast over others,
but only to lie low in abasement of spirit.
And what I write is not in any dominion and authority of my own,
but rather to bring others into that dominion and authority which is good for me,
and for everyone else, to be subject to.
May the Lord strip us of our own understanding,
and of that righteousness which is but ours (though we have called it his),
so that we may be gathered into and receive his understanding,
be clothed with his righteousness, and feel his rest and peace!
And happy is he that loses all to gain this.
But he that keeps what he has too long will in the end lose all.
Therefore, be no longer wise in the eye of flesh, or according to what man calls wisdom;
but be _truly_ wise.

=== SOME POSITIONS / Concerning the Apostasy from the Christian Spirit and Life

[.alt]
==== Position I

That there has been a great apostasy^
footnote:[i.e. falling away, departure]
from the Spirit of Christ, and from the true light and life of Christianity,
which apostasy began in the apostles`' days, and ripened quickly afterwards.

Now, that the apostles and Christians in their days had the true Spirit,
the true light, and true life, I think will not be denied.
"`We know that we are of God, and that the Son of God is come,
and has given us an understanding that we may know him that is true;
and we are in him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.
This is the true God, and eternal life.`"
1 John 5:19-20. They were truly born of God, and knew the Son of God come,
receiving from him a true understanding,
and the true light and knowledge in that understanding.
Both the understanding and the knowledge were rooted and seated in him that is true,
where their position and abiding were ("`we are in him that is true`"),
where they met with the true Spirit, the true God, the true life, even life eternal.
That they had the true Spirit from God ("`because you are sons,
God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts...`" Gal. 4:6),
that they had the true light from God ("`God who
commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
has shined into our hearts...`" 2 Cor. 4:6),
that they had the true life from and in the Spirit ("`if we live in the Spirit,
let us also walk in the Spirit.`"
Gal. 5:25), is generally acknowledged concerning them.

Now the Scriptures make mention of an apostasy from this,
beginning even in the apostles`' days, and to be completed not long after.
The Apostle Paul speaks expressly of the thing,
that there must come "`a falling away,`" and a revealing of "`the man of sin,
the son of perdition.`"
2 Thess. 2:3. Christ had showed and declared the path of life;
he had disclosed the true church,
which was "`the pillar and ground of truth,`" against
which the gates of hell could not prevail.
He had sent the true Spirit,
which could "`lead into all truth,`" and preserve in the truth.
But we read there must spring up a "`man of sin, a son of perdition,`" who, in a mystery,
should work against this, and cause a falling from this to another thing.
And of this the apostle did not only touch on here in writing,
but he had also told them of these things in person,
to which he refers in verse 5. Many more evidences of scriptures may be given.

Christ foretold of false prophets, Matt. 7:15. "`Beware of false prophets,
which come to you in sheep`'s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.`"
The Lord sent true prophets under the law, and gave them true visions to declare.
Christ sent true apostles and ministers under the gospel,
and gave them the truth which they should preach and propagate.
But then there were also false prophets, false apostles, and ministers to come after,
who were never sent by Christ, nor ever received the truth from his Spirit.
Now these did not come to gather into the life and truth of Christ,
but to scatter from it, and thereby to begin an apostasy, a falling away.
Beware of them, says Christ, for they come very subtly.
They come in sheep`'s clothing; they put the garment of the sheep upon their backs,
even that very garment which the sheep did wear.
But these do not have the nature of the sheep, but rather the nature of the wolf,
which is ravenous towards the life of the sheep.
Consider this: where there is the garment without, but not the nature within;
where there is the form of godliness, but not the power;
where there are scripture words and practices,
but not the Spirit of life from which they came; there is the false prophet!
There is the wolf!
There is the apostate!
There is the seducer from Christ!

Again, Christ foretells of many false prophets,
Matt. 24:11. "`And many false prophets will rise, and will deceive many.`"
And verse 24, "`For there will arise false christs, and false prophets,
and will show great signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were possible,
they will deceive the very elect.`"

And as Christ himself, so his apostles also after him, by the same Spirit,
foretold the same thing.

The Apostle Paul speaks of seducing spirits in the latter times,
and of doctrines of devils,
which would prevail to cause a departure in some from the faith.
1 Tim. 4:1. And if, in those days,
the power of seducers was so great as to draw from the
truth (which was then so manifest and living),
how easy it would be to keep from the truth afterwards,
when it had been long lost and out of remembrance,
and thereby deceit gotten into the place and name of it.

The Apostle Peter also foretold of "`false teachers,`"
who should "`secretly bring in damnable heresies,
even denying the Lord that bought them: These would so prevail, says Peter,
that their "`pernicious ways`" should be followed by many,
and "`the way of truth evil spoken of.`"
2 Pet. 2:1-2.

Again, Paul, in his second epistle to Timothy, speaks of the last days,
that the times therein should be "`perilous,`" chap. 3.
Christ had said, "`The love of many should wax cold, and iniquity abound.`"
Matt. 24:12. And Paul shows how the times would prove very perilous,
by the abounding of iniquity.
"`In the last days perilous times will come, for men will be lovers of themselves,
covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce,
despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded,
lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.`"
2 Tim. 3:1-4. Behold what kind of fruit sprung up from the false
doctrine of the false teachers in this apostasy from the truth.
And yet all this came under a form of godliness--
"`having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.`"
verse 5. Christ sent the power of godliness into the world,
to subdue the root from whence all this springs, to kill the evil nature inwardly.
But in the apostasy the evil nature is not killed,
because the power is denied which would kill it,
and the outward form of religion is kept up to cover the evil nature within.

Look anywhere among the leaders of the apostasy and see: Is self-love killed?
Is covetousness killed?
Are boasting and pride killed?
Is the love of pleasures killed?
Are persecutions and oppressions killed?
And are man`'s honor and glory laid in the dust?
No, they are but covered with an outward form.
Their life is still in them,
for the power wherewith they should be killed was at first denied,
and now is lost and not known.
Where there is life, there is the power; and where there is the power,
the evil nature is killed.
But where the evil nature is not killed, there is only a form of godliness, a covering,
a painted sepulcher, but rottenness within.

Now those last days and last times were not far off, but began then,
for the apostle exhorts Timothy to turn away from such, verse 5,
"`From such turn away,`" implying that even then there were such to be turned away from.
And he says, verse 8, that they did then resist the truth, like Jannes and Jambres,
who did strive to resist the life and power that was in Moses.
Thus these were come even then, when the apostle wrote this epistle to Timothy.

And Jude says, that "`ungodly men, turning the grace of God into lasciviousness,
and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ,`" were "`crept in`" already,
verse 4 of his epistle.
And the Apostle John speaks very expressly, 1 John 2:18-19. "`Little children,
it is the last time; and as you have heard that antichrist will come,
even now there are many antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time.
They went out from us,`" etc.
Christ, instructing his disciples concerning the last times,
tells them there will arise false christs, with great power of deceit.
Matt. 24:24. Now, says John here, there are come "`many antichrists,
whereby we know it is the last time.`"
These did not abide in the doctrines of the apostles,
who preached "`the everlasting gospel,`" nor in
the spirit and principle which they were in;
but "`went out`" from them, from their spirit (from the anointing to which they kept,
and by which they were kept) into another spirit, and preached another gospel.
The gospel of antichrist was not the power of God to kill what is earthly,
but rather consisted in a dead,
literal knowledge of things whereby the earthly might be fed and kept alive.

Look now into the state of the churches then,
according to what the Scripture records of them,
and the symptoms of the apostasy will plainly appear.
The church of Ephesus (among whom some of the grievous wolves had entered,
Acts 20:29) had left their first love.
Rev. 2:4. The churches of Galatia were bewitched from the gospel.
Gal. 3:1. The church at Colossae was entangled,
and made subject to the rudiments of the world,
and ordinances (which perish with the using)
after the commandments and doctrines of men. Col. 2:20,22.
The church at Corinth also was haunted with false apostles, 2 Cor. 11:12-13,
insomuch that the apostle was afraid lest that church should be corrupted by them.
verse 3. The church in Pergamus had those who held the doctrine of Balaam.
Rev. 2:14. The church in Thyatira allowed the woman Jezebel,
who called herself a prophetess, to seduce and bring forth children in the apostasy.
Rev. 2:20,23. The church in Sardis had a name to be alive, but was dead,
Rev. 3:1, having defiled her garments.
verse 4. The church in Laodicea looked upon herself as rich, and increased with goods,
and as having need of nothing, but indeed was wretched, miserable, poor,
blind (so then the eye was put out), and naked, lacking the gold, lacking the clothing,
lacking the eye-salve.
Rev. 3:17-18. And lastly, all the Gentiles were warned by Paul,
in his epistle to the church at Rome, to look to their standing, lest they,
falling from the faith, from the truth, from the life,
into the apostasy (as the Jews had done), might also feel the severity of God,
as the Jews had.
Rom. 11:20-22.

Thus it is evident that the apostasy had gotten footing,
and begun to spread in the apostles`' days.
And the Apostle John, in the Spirit, beholding the future state of things,
sees it over-spread and over-running all--
"`all nations drunk with the cup of fornication.`"
Rev. 18:3. The way of truth had been maligned long before, 2 Pet. 2:2,
and the Rock of Ages, which alone can establish in the truth, had been forsaken.
All became as a sea,
and up rose the beast (which could not rise while the power of truth stood),
and the woman upon the beast, with the cup of deceit and error from the life in her hand.
This cup she gives all the nations to drink, and they drink, and are drunk with it,
so that all nations have been intoxicated with
the doctrines and practices of the apostasy.
They have taken that for truth which the harlot told them was truth,
and they have observed those things as the commands of
God which the harlot told them were the commands of God.
And by this means they have never come to be married to Christ, to be in union with him,
to receive the law of life from his Spirit,
and to know the liberty from the bondage of corruption.
Rather, they have been in the bed of fornication with the harlot, and have pleased,
glutted, and satisfied themselves with this fornication.
Thus corruption did overspread all the earth.

And though God reserved to himself a remnant to worship him,
and to give some testimony to his truth during all this time,
yet the "`beast`" (which was managed by the harlot) had power over them,
power to make war with them, power to overcome them.
Rev. 13:7. The "`beast`" had power over all "`kindreds, tongues,
and nations`" everywhere,
to overcome the "`saints,`" and suppress the truth they were moved to give testimony to;
and to set up the worship of the "`beast,`" and make all the earth fall down before that.
Rev. 13:7-8.

Now, by what has been expressed,
is it not manifest to every eye in simplicity and plainness,
that there has been a great apostasy from the true knowledge of Christ,
and that a universal corruption and power of death has sprung
up in the place of the power of his life and grace?
"`The grace of God, which brings salvation,`" has disappeared,
and "`the abomination of desolation`" has taken up its place,
and filled it with deadly venom against the truth, and against the life.
So that enmity against God, under a pretense of love and zeal to him,
has generally reigned in the hearts of men,
from the times of the apostles to this present day.

[.alt]
==== Position II

That in this great apostasy, the true state of Christianity has been lost.
If they apostatized from the Spirit, from the light, from the life,
then they were gone from it--they lost it.

Now, it could be described in a multitude of particulars how
the state of Christianity has been lost,
but this would be too vast and tedious.
It may suffice, therefore, to set forth a few considerable examples.

=== 1. The true rule of Christianity was lost.

The rule of a Christian, which is to direct, guide, and order him in his whole course,
was apostatized from, and lost.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What is a Christian`'s rule,^
footnote:[The word _rule_ is used throughout to refer to that which governs, rules,
or has true authority in the life of the believer.]
whereby he is to steer and order his course?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: A Christian is to be a follower of Christ,
and consequently must have the same rule to walk by as Christ had.
A Christian proceeds out from Christ, has the same life in him,
and therefore needs the same rule.
Christ had the fullness of life,
and of his fullness we all receive a measure of the same life.
"`We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.`"
Eph. 5:30. Indeed, we came out of the same spring of life from whence he came:
"`For both he that sanctifies, and they who are sanctified, are all of one;
for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren.`"
Heb. 2:11. Now what was his rule?
Was it not the fullness of life which he received?
And what is the rule of those who are sanctified?
Is it not the measure of life which they receive?
Was not Christ`'s rule the law of the Spirit, the law which the Spirit wrote in his heart?
And is not their rule the law of the Spirit,
the law which the Spirit writes in their hearts?

How was Christ made a king and a priest?
Was it by the law of a carnal commandment, or by the power of an endless life?
And how are they made kings and priests to God?
Rev. 1:6. Is it by the law of a carnal commandment,
or is it by the power of the same endless life?
"`Lo, I come to do your will, O God,`" says Christ, "`when he comes into the world.`"
Heb. 10:5,7. But by what rule?
By what law? "`Your law is within my heart.`" Ps. 40:8.
And the same Spirit who wrote it there, is also to write the new covenant,
with all the laws of it, in the heart of every Christian, from the least to the greatest.
Heb. 8:9-10. Yes, the same Spirit that dwelt in Christ`'s heart,
is to dwell in their hearts, according to the promise of the covenant.
Ezek. 36:27.

This was Paul`'s rule, according to which he walked,
"`the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus.`"
Rom. 8:1-2. This made him "`free from the law of sin and death.`"
Where is the law of sin written?
Where is the law of death written?
Is it not written in the heart?
And must not the law of righteousness and life be written there also,
if it be able to deal with sin and death?
The Spirit forms the heart anew, forms Christ in the heart,
begets a new creature there which cannot sin "`(He that is
born of God sins not).`" And this is the rule of righteousness,
the new creature, or the spirit of life in the new creature.
Gal. 6:15-16. "`In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision avails anything,
nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them.`"
Note: here is the rule--the new creature,
which is begotten in everyone that is born of God.
"`If any man be in Christ,
he is a new creature;`" and this new creature is to be his rule.
And as any man walks according to this rule, according to the new creature,
according to the law of light and life that the Spirit
continually breathes into the new creature,
he has peace.
But as he transgresses that, and walks not after the Spirit, but after the flesh,
he walks out of the light, out of the life, out of the peace, into the sea,
into the death, into the trouble, into the condemnation.

Here then is the law of the converted man--the new creature;
and the law of the new creature is the Spirit of life which begat him, which lives,
and breathes, and gives forth his law continually in him.
"`You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.`"
1 John 2:20. How came they to know all things?
Does not John say it was by the "`anointing`"? The anointing was in them,
a fountain or well-spring of light and life,
issuing forth continually such rivers and streams of life within,
as they needed no other teacher in the truth and way of life. verse 27.
The "`Comforter`" did refresh their hearts sufficiently,
and led them into all truth.

Search the apostles`' epistles,
and you will find them testifying of the Lord`'s
sending his Spirit into the hearts of Christians.
You will find exhortations to them not to grieve or quench the Spirit,
but to follow as they were led.
They were to "`live in the Spirit,`" and to "`walk in the Spirit.`"
Gal. 5:25. And the Spirit was to walk, and live,
and bring forth his own life and power in them.
2 Cor. 6:16. And what can be the proper and full rule of God`'s
sons and daughters except the light of the Spirit of life,
which they receive from their Father?
In this way God did advance the state of a believer
above the state of the Jews under the law.
For the outward Jew had the law written with the finger of God, yet in tablets of stone.
But we have the law written by the finger of God in the tablet of our hearts.
Theirs was a law without, at a distance from them,
and the priest`'s lips were to preserve the knowledge of it, and to instruct them in it.
But now there is a law within, close at hand,
the immediate light of the Spirit of life shining immediately in the heart.
Those that know this inward law need no man to teach them;
but have the Spirit of prophecy in themselves, and living teachings from him continually.
These are made such kings and priests to God, as the state of the law did but represent.

The gospel is the substance of all the shadows contained in the law.
A Christian is he that comes into this substance, and lives in this substance,
and in whom this substance lives; and his rule is the substance itself,
in which he lives, and which lives in him.
Christ is the substance, who lives in the Christian, and he in Christ.
Christ lives in him by his Spirit, and he lives in Christ by the same Spirit.
There he lives, and has fellowship with the Father and the Son,
in the light wherein they live, and not by any outward rule.
1 John 1:6-7.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But what is the rule now in the apostasy?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Among the Catholics, the rule is the Scripture,
interpreted by the church (as they call themselves),
with a mixture of their own precepts and traditions.

Among the Protestants, the rule is the Scriptures,
according as they can understand them by their own study,
or according as they can receive an understanding of
them from such men as they account orthodox.
And from here arise continual differences and groups and sects;
one following this interpretation, another that.

This is a grievous apostasy, which is the root, spring,
and foundation of all the rest; for he that misses in his beginning,
he that begins his religion without the true rule,
how can he proceed aright in anything afterwards?

[.discourse-part]
Objection: But are not the Scriptures the word of God?
And is not the word of God to be a Christian`'s rule?
If everyone should be left to his own spirit,
what confusion and uncertainty would this produce!

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The Scriptures are not that living Word,
which is appointed by God to be the rule of a Christian;
but they contain words spoken by the Spirit of God, testifying of that Word,
and pointing to that Word which is to be the rule.
"`Search the Scriptures, for in them you think to have eternal life,
and these are they which testify of me;
and you will not come to me that you may have life.`"
John 5:39-40. The Scriptures are to be searched for
the testimony which they give of Christ;
and when that testimony is received, Christ is to be found, and life received from him.
But the Pharisees formerly,
and Christians since (I mean Christians in name) search the Scriptures,
but do not come to Christ for the life.
Rather, they stick to the letter of the Scriptures, and oppose the life with the letter.
They keep themselves from the life by their wisdom and knowledge in the letter.
In this way they put the Scriptures into the place of Christ,
and so honor neither Christ nor the Scriptures.

It would have been no honor to John the Baptist to have been taken for the Light.
John`'s honor was to point to it.
Nor is it any honor to the Scriptures to be called the Word of God;
but their honor is to uncover and testify of the Word.
Now hear what the Scriptures call the Word; "`In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.`" John 1:1.
"`And the Word was made flesh.`" verse 14.
This was the name of Christ when he came into the world in the flesh,
to sow his life in the world.
And when he comes again into the world, out of a far country,
to fight with the beast and false prophet,
and to cleanse the earth of the harlot`'s fornication and idols,
he shall have the same name again; "`his name is called the Word of God.`"
Rev. 19:13. Therefore Peter calls that,
"`the Word of God which lives and abides forever.`"
1 Pet. 1:23. And this Word that lives and
abides forever was the Word that they preached.
verse 25. And they that believed did not simply applaud
the words that the apostles spoke for the Word,
but rather received the thing they spoke of,
"`the ingrafted Word,`" which being received with a meek, quiet, and submissive spirit,
"`is able to save the soul.`"
Jam. 1:21. This is "`the Word of faith`" that is "`near,
in the heart and in the mouth.`" Rom. 10:8.
This is the Word that stands at the door of the heart,
and desires to be let in
"`(Behold, I stand at the door and knock).`"
And when it is let in,
it speaks in the heart what is to be heard and done.
It is near; it is in the heart and in the mouth.
To what end?
"`That you might hear it, and do it.`"
The living Word, which is
"`quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword,`"
dividing in the mouth, and dividing in the heart,
the vile from the precious.
Yes, it reaches to the very inmost part of the heart,
and cuts between the roots, Heb. 4:12.
This Word you are to hear and do.
You are to part with all vile words, the vile manner of living,
the vile course and worship of the world outwardly,
and the vile thoughts and course of sin inwardly,
just as fast as the Word uncovers them to you.
And you are to exercise yourself in that which
is folly and madness to the eye of the world,
and a grievous cross to your own worldly nature.
Indeed, when the Word reaches to the very nature, life, and spirit within,
then the fleshly life in the heart must not be spared.
Nor should the foolish,
weak thing (to man`'s wise eye) which rises in its place be rejected, which,
when it is received, is but like a little seed, even the least of seeds.
This seed is the word of life; it is the true, living rule, and way to eternal life.
And here is the true obedience--the hearing and doing of the Word.
"`He that has an ear, let him hear.`"

Examine yourselves whether you be in the faith.
"`Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you,
except you be reprobates?`" 2 Cor. 13:5.
Are you in the faith?
Then Christ is in you.
Is Christ not in you?
Then you are in the reprobate state, out of the faith.
Is Christ in you, and should he not hold the reins, and rule?
Should the living Word be in the heart, and not be the rule of the heart?
Should he speak in the heart,
and the man or woman in whom he speaks run to the words of Scripture formerly spoken,
to know whether these be his words or no?
No, no, his sheep know his voice better than this.
Did the apostle John, who had seen and tasted and handled and preached the Word of life,
send Christians to his epistles, or any other part of Scripture, to be their rule?
No, he directed them to the anointing as a sufficient teacher.
1 John 2:27. "`He that believes in me, as the Scripture has said,
out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.`"
John 7:38. He that has the fountain of life in him,
issuing out rivers of living water continually,
has he need to go elsewhere to fetch water?
"`The kingdom of heaven is within you,`" says Christ; and he bids "`seek the kingdom.`"
Light the candle, sweep your own house, seek diligently for the kingdom; there it is,
if you can find it.
Now he that has found the kingdom within, should he look without,
into words spoken about the kingdom, to find the laws of the kingdom?
Are not the laws of the kingdom to be found within the kingdom?
Is the kingdom in the heart, and yet the laws of the kingdom written without in a book?
Is not the gospel the ministration of the Spirit?
And shall he who has received the Spirit run back to the letter to be his guide?
Shall the living Spirit, that gave forth the Scriptures, be present,
and not have preeminence above his own written words?

What is the proper intent of the letter?
Is it not to testify of the Spirit, and to bring one to the Spirit?
The law, the prophets, John, led to Christ in the flesh;
and he was to be the increasing light, while they should decrease.
Christ`'s words in the flesh, the apostles`' words afterwards, and all words since,
are but to lead to Christ in the Spirit, to the eternal and living substance.
And when the words of Christ, of the apostles,
or any other words spoken from the same Spirit in these days,
have brought one to the Spirit,
to the feeling and settling of the soul in the living foundation,
and to the building and perfecting of the man of God therein,
they have then attained their end and glory.
But to praise the written words, without understanding their voice,
while keeping at a distance from the thing that they invite to,
this puts the words out of their place, out of their proper use and service,
and so attains neither their end nor their glory.
And even if man puts upon these words that which seems to be a greater glory,
namely, to make them his rule and guide,
this is but a dishonor both to them and to the
Spirit who gave them for a different purpose.

Now for the other part of the objection,
that if men should be left to their own spirits,
and should follow the guidance of their own spirits,
it would produce confusion and uncertainty: I do acknowledge it; it would indeed do so!
But we are not here speaking of leaving a man to his own spirit,
but rather directing and guiding a man to the Word and Spirit of life;
to know and hear the voice of Christ,
which gathers and translates man out of his own spirit into Christ`'s Spirit.
Here there is no confusion or uncertainty; but rather order, certainty, and stability.

The light of God`'s Spirit is a certain and infallible rule,
and the eye that sees it is a certain eye.
Man`'s understanding of the Scriptures is uncertain and fallible.
He, not having the true ear, receives a literal,
uncertain knowledge of things into his uncertain understanding, and deceives his soul.
In this way, in the midst of his wisdom and knowledge of the Scriptures,
man is lost in his own erring and uncertain mind, and his soul deceived,
for lack of a true root and foundation in himself.
But he that is come to the true Shepherd, and knows his voice, he cannot be deceived.
Yes, he can read the Scriptures safely,
and taste the true sweetness of the words that came from the life.

But the man who is outside of the life feeds on the husks,
and can receive nothing more.
He has gathered a dead, dry, literal, husky knowledge out of the Scriptures,
and this he can relish.
But when the life of the words and things there spoken of is declared to him,
he cannot receive them, he himself being outside of that wherein they were written,
and wherein alone they can be understood.
So then, such a man having lost the life, what else can he do?
He can do no other than praise the written letter, though his soul is starved,
and lies in famine and death, for lack of the bread of life.

The Scribes and Pharisees made a great noise about the
law and ordinances of Moses,
claiming that Christ and his disciples were breakers and profaners of them.
Yet they themselves did not truly honor the law and ordinances of Moses,
but rather their own doctrines, commandments, and traditions.
So it is now with those who make a great noise about the Scriptures,
and about the institutions of the apostles.
These do not honor the Scriptures, or the institutions of the apostles;
but rather their own meanings, their own conceivings,
their own inventions and imaginations thereupon.
They run to the Scriptures with that understanding which is outside of the truth,
and which never shall be let into the truth.
And when they are not able to reach and comprehend the truth as it is, they then study,
they invent, they imagine a meaning.
They form a likeness, a similitude of the truth as near as they can,
and this must pass for the truth; and this then they honor and bow to as the will of God,
though it is not the will of God, but a likeness of their own inventing and forming.
They do not worship God, nor honor the Scriptures,
but they honor and worship the works of their own brain.
And every scripture which man has in this way formed a meaning out of,
and has not read in the true and living light of God`'s eternal Spirit,
he has made an image thereby; he has made an idol of.
And the respect and honor he gives to this meaning,
is not a respect and honor given to God, but rather to his own image, to his own idol.

Oh, how many are your idols, you Christians of England!
How full of images and idols are you, you spiritual notionists!
You have run from one idea to another,
with the same mind and spirit with which you began at first!
But the founder of images has never been discovered and destroyed in you,
and so he is still at work among you all;
and great will your sorrow and distress be when the Lord`'s quick eye searches him out,
and reveals his just wrath against him.

In my heart and soul I honor the Scriptures,
and I long to read them with the pure eye,
and in the pure light of the living Spirit of God.
But the Lord preserve me from reading one line of them in my own will,
or interpreting any part of them according to my own understanding,
but only as I am guided, led, and enlightened by him,
in the will and understanding which come from him.
In his light, all Scripture,
every writing of God`'s Spirit which is from the breath of his life,
is profitable to build up and perfect the man of God.
But the instructions, the reproofs, the observations, the rules,
the grounds of hope and comfort,
or whatever else which man gathers out from the
Scriptures (he himself being outside of the life),
these do not have the true profit, nor build up the true thing.

=== 2. The true worship was lost.

The true worship of God in the gospel is in the Spirit.
"`The hour comes, and now is,
when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth;
for the Father seeks such to worship him.`"
John 4:23. The true worship is in the spirit, and in the truth,
and the true worshipers worship there.
Such worshipers the Father seeks, and such worship he accepts;
but all other worship is false worship, and all other worshipers are false worshipers.
Did not God refuse Cain`'s sacrifice formerly?
And can he now accept any sacrifice or worship that is offered in that nature?
He that worships without the Spirit, he worships in Cain`'s nature.
But he that worships aright, must have his nature changed,
and must worship in that faith, in that life, in that nature,
in that Spirit whereby and whereto he is changed.
For without being in this, and abiding in this,
it is impossible to please God in anything.

He that is the true worshiper must keep to the law of faith,
the law of the Spirit of Life in him,
the law which he receives by faith fresh from the Spirit of Life continually.
He must hear and observe the voice of the living Word in all his worship,
and must worship in the presence and power and guidance of that Word.

I shall give only the example of prayer.
"`Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit.`" Eph. 6:18.
Notice: all prayer and supplication must be in the Spirit.
If a man speak ever so much from his own spirit,
with ever so much earnestness and affection, yet this is no prayer.
It is prayer only so far as the Spirit moves it,
and so far as the Spirit leads and guides in it.
If a man begins without the Spirit, or goes on without the Spirit,
this is not in the true worship; this is in his own will, and so it is will-worship.^
footnote:[Will-worship is a term used to refer to any
form of worship that is according to the will,
time, and resources of man.]
It is according to his own understanding and nature, both of which are to be crucified,
and not to be followed in any way under the gospel.
"`We are the circumcision, which worship God in the Spirit,`"
(here are the true worshipers, "`the circumcision;`" and here is the true worship,
"`in the Spirit;`") "`and have no confidence in the flesh.`"
If a man address himself to any worship of God without his Spirit,
is this not confidence in the flesh?
If he begins without the moving of his Spirit, does he not begin in the flesh?
If he goes on without the Spirit`'s carrying on,
does he not proceed in the strength and confidence of the flesh?
But the worship of the Spirit is in the Spirit`'s will, and time,
and is carried on by his light and power.
This power keeps down the intellectual and affectionate part of man,
wherein all the world worships, offering up the unaccepted sacrifices,
even the lame and the blind offerings, which God`'s soul hates.

Now the worship that is not found in man`'s will and time,
but rather in that which abides forever, this worship is continual.
There is a continual praying unto God.
There is a continual blessing and praising of his name, in eating, or drinking,
or whatever else is done.
There is a continual bowing to the majesty of the Lord in every thought,
in every word, in every action.
This is the true worship,
and this is the rest or Sabbath wherein the true worshipers worship.

When the creation of God is finished; when the child is formed in the light,
and the life breathed into him; then God brings him forth into his holy land,
where he keeps his Sabbath.
These are in the faith which is the substance of the things hoped for under the law.
They have come out from all the shadows and types of the law,
and from all the heathenish observations of days and times in the spirit of this world,
into the true Sabbath, into the true rest, where they have no more to work,
but God works all in them in his own time, according to his own pleasure.
"`We who have believed, do enter into rest.`"
Heb. 4:3. "`And he that is entered into his rest, has ceased from his works,
as God from his.`"
verse 10. He that has the least taste of faith knows a measure of rest,
finding the life working in him.
His soul is daily led further and further into life by the working of the life,
and the heavy yoke of his own laboring after life is taken off from his shoulders.
Now this is the truth, the life, the Sabbath,
and the worship of the soul that is led into the truth, and preserved in the truth.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But what is the worship now in the apostasy?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Among the Catholics, it is a very gross worship;
a worship more carnal than was ever the worship of the old covenant law.
For though the law in its nature was outward and carnal,
yet it was taught and prescribed by the wisdom of God, and was profitable in its place,
and to its end.
But the worship among the Catholics was invented by the corrupt wisdom,
and set up in the corrupt will of man, and has no true profit,
but keeps one from the life, from the power, from the Spirit, in fleshly observations,
which feed and please the fleshly nature.
Look upon their days consecrated to saints, and their canonical hours of prayer,
and their praying in an unknown tongue +++[+++Latin], with their fastings, feastings,
saying of Ave Marias, Paternosters, Creeds, etc.
Are not all these outside of the life, out of the Spirit,
and after the invention and will of the flesh?

And the worship of the Protestants is not much different.
For their worship is also from a fleshly principle, and in their own times and wills,
and according to their own understanding and apprehension of things.
It comes not from the rising up and guidance of
the infallible life of the Spirit in them;
for that they will quench.
They also observe days and times, and perishing ordinances,
and are not come out of the flesh, into that Spirit where true worship is to be known.

=== 3. The faith, the true faith, was lost.

The faith which gives victory over the world;
the faith which feeds the life of the just, and slays the unjust;
the faith which is pure and gives entrance into the rest of God;
the faith which is the substance of things hoped for,
and the evidence of things not seen; this faith has been lost.

For those who bear the name of Christian, and say they believe in Christ,
and have faith in him, cannot with their faith overcome the world;
but rather are daily overcome by the world.
Are not these Christians found in the honors, or in the fashions, or in the customs,
or in the worships of the world?
Indeed they are so far from overcoming these, that they are overcome by them!

And the faith of these Christians (so called) is not a mystery^
footnote:[Penington uses the word _mystery_ to refer to
that which cannot be known by natural faculties,
but must be revealed by the Spirit of God.]
(they know not the mystery of it, which is held in a pure conscience),
but rather consists in believing a historical relation,
and in a fleshly improving of that, and can be held in an impure conscience.

They have not entered into rest by their faith;
for they do not know the true Sabbath in the Lord, but are still in a shadowy Sabbath.
Neither is it the substance of what they hope for;
but the substance of what they hope for is still foreign to them.
They are not come to "`Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
to the innumerable company of angels,
to the general assembly and church of the first-born, to God the Judge,
Christ the Mediator,
and the blood of sprinkling,`" and so to unity and certainty in the life.
Rather, these remain in mere opinions, ways,
and practices suitable to the earthly spirit; which may easily be shaken,
and must be shaken down to the ground, if ever they will know the building of God,
and the true faith.

=== 4. The love, the true love, was lost.

The innocent love, which thinks no evil, nor wishes evil,
much less can do any evil to any; but suffers long, and is kind, meek, humble,
not seeking its own, but the good of others; this love was lost.
The unfeigned love was banished; and a feigned love,
such a love as enmity and violence proceed from, has taken the place of it.
The true love loves the enemy, and cannot return enmity for enmity,
but seeks the good of those who hate it.
But this counterfeit love can persecute and hate that which it calls a friend, yes,
even a brother, because of some difference in opinion or practice.
The love that was in Christ taught him to lay down his life for his sheep;
and he that has the same love, can lay down his life for his brother.
But the love that is now among Christians tends rather to the taking away of life.

What is the love among the Catholics?
Look to their inquisitions, their wraths, their burnings at the stake, etc.
What is the love in New England?
It is a love that will imprison or banish their brother if he
differ even a little in judgment or practice about worship.
Indeed, they whip, burn in the hand, cut off ears, just like the bishops of Old England.
If one had told them, when they fled from the persecution of the bishops here,
that they themselves would do such things, they would have been apt to reply, '`What?
Are we dogs that return to vomit?`'
But they fled from the cross, which would have crucified that persecuting spirit,
and so they carried it alive with them to New England.

And what is the love here in Old England?
Is it not a love that whips, stocks, imprisons, stones, and mocks?
Yes, the very teachers (which should be patterns of love to others) will cast into prison,
and take the goods of their brother.
See the _Record of Sufferings for Tithes in England,_
which may make any tender heart bleed to read it,
and will lie as a brand of infamy on the magistracy and
ministry of England to succeeding generations.

Is this the love of the righteous seed?
Or is it Cain`'s love, which is a mere profession, in word, in show,
but not in deed and in truth?
How can such men love God?
No, if the true love of God were in them, this enmity could not stand,
nor such bad fruit spring forth.
These have not seen the Father or the Son.

"`By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.`"
And by this all men may know,
that those that now go for Christians are not Christ`'s disciples,
in that they _do not_ love one another.
They are not at unity in the light, and so cannot love one another there.
Their unity consists only in outward forms, in opinions, in professions, in practices;
and so any difference there quickly stirs up the enmity,
causing risings in the heart against each other.
But true love grows from true union and fellowship in the light.
Where that is not known, there cannot be true love in the Spirit,
but only a feigned love in the flesh.

=== 5. The true hope, joy, and peace are lost.

The true ground of hope is Christ in the heart,
and the true hope is that which arises from this ground,
from the experiencing of Christ there;
"`Christ in you the hope of glory.`" Col. 1:27.
What is the true Christian`'s hope?
It is Christ in him;
he "`has eternal life abiding in him;`" and he knows this cannot but lead to glory.
But what is the common Christian`'s hope?
He fastens his hope upon the words he has read, upon belief in a written testimony.
He reads, "`He that believes shall be saved.`"
I believe, he thinks, therefore I shall be saved.
And thus, even as he has raised up the wrong faith, and the wrong love,
so he raises up a wrong hope.
And this hope will perish; for it is the hope of the hypocrite.
It is a hope in the hypocritical nature, which complies with scripture words,
but is not in union with God, nor with the life of the Scriptures.
And so being without the anchor, is tossed by the waves of the sea.

The true joy is in the Spirit, from what is felt, and enjoyed,
and hoped for there.
But the common Christian`'s joy is from things which he
gathers into and comprehends in his understanding;
or from flickers of emotion which he feels in the affectionate part,
from a fire and sparks of his own kindling, where he finds his warmth and comfort.

And the true peace stands in the reconciliation with God,
by having that broken down which causes the wrath.
The Lamb of God breaks down the wall of separation in the heart.
The blood of Jesus (wherein is the life) cleanses away the sin there,
makes the heart pure, and unites the pure heart to the pure God.
Here is union, here is fellowship, here is peace.
But the common Christian`'s peace is from a misunderstanding of Scriptures,
while the wall of separation remains standing,
and while wickedness still lodges in the heart.
They reason among themselves, using scriptural words, that God is at peace with them,
and that they are in union with him.
But all the while, that which is truly of God within them witnesses against them,
wars with them, and there is no peace.

=== 6. The true repentance, conversion, and regeneration have been lost.

The true repentance is from dead works,
and from the dead principle from where all the dead works proceed.
But these have not been repented of, but rather cherished in the apostasy.
The building up and exercise of religion in the apostasy has
been in that understanding which must be destroyed.
And the carnal will, which should have been crucified,
has been pleased and fed with this religion.

The true conversion is from the power of Satan to God,
from the darkness to the light.
But in the apostasy, men have not known God or Satan, the light or the darkness;
but have erred, taking the one for the other,
worshiping the devil instead of God, Rev. 13:4,
and following the dark conceivings of their own minds concerning Scripture,
and calling it light.

Regeneration is a changing of man by the birth that is of the Spirit.
It is the stripping of the creature of its own nature, of its own understanding,
of its own will, and forming it anew in the womb of the Spirit;
so that the old creature is passed away, and a new thing comes forth,
which grows up daily in the new life towards the fullness of Christ.
But now, if men could only open their eyes, they would see that their birth is fleshly,
and consists, at best, in a conformity to the letter,
which the old nature may imitate and attain.
But the immortal seed is not sprung up in them.
They are not dead to the mortal, nor alive to the immortal.

=== 7. The true wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are lost.

The true wisdom stands in the fear of God, and in departing from evil.
Those who are taught of God learn this wisdom, and are thereby made wise unto salvation.
But most that are called Christians are not come to the fear of God;
and look down upon it as legal, and not pertaining to the gospel.

The true righteousness stands in the faith,
in hearing and obeying the Word of faith.
From what came the righteousness of the law,
but by hearing and obeying the voice of the law?
From what comes the righteousness of the gospel,
but by hearing and obeying the Word of faith,
who is preached (and who is the Preacher) in the heart?
The Apostle Paul makes this comparison.
Rom. 10. The righteousness of the law speaks thus, "`The man that does these things,
shall live in them.`"
But how speaks the Word of faith?
"`The word is close to you, in your mouth,
and in your heart;`" he that does and hears that Word, shall live in it.
"`The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God,
and they that hear shall live.`"
Disobedience to the written law was unrighteousness, and brought death.
Likewise, disobedience to the living Word is unrighteousness,
and cannot be justified, but condemned.
When the soul hears, believes, and obeys, then it is justified;
then its former sins are forgotten, and this is imputed to it as righteousness.
But when the soul will not hear, will not believe, will not obey,
this unbelief is judged in him, and his sins are retained, and not remitted.

The true sanctification consists in the growth of the seed, and its spreading,
like leaven, over the heart, and over the whole man.
By faith Christ is formed in the heart; and as this seed, this leaven, this man grows,
so he makes the person holy in whom he grows.
The seed of life, the kingdom of heaven, is a holy thing; and as it grows and spreads,
it purges out the old leaven, and makes the lump new.
But now, in Christians that have grown up in the apostasy, this seed is not known.
This leaven is not discerned.
So their holiness consists in a conformity to rules of Scripture,
received into the old heart and understanding.
And what a noise has man`'s holiness made in the world,
throughout all the night of the apostasy!

Redemption consists in being bought by the price of the life, out of sin,
out of death, out of the earth, out of the power of the devil.
It is a casting off of the strong man out of the heart, with all that he brought in,
and a delivering from his power.
It is a dissolving of the work of sin, which the devil has wrought in the heart,
and a setting the soul, which is immortal, at liberty, free from sin,
and free unto righteousness.
This is the true redemption.
But the redemption in the apostasy is a feigned redemption, wherein salvation from sin,
and the devil, and his power, is not felt or experienced;
but the strong man is still in the heart, and keeps the soul in death,
and brings forth fruits of death daily.

The Christians formerly (in the first day of the
breaking forth of God`'s power) had Christ in them,
the living Word.
They opened their hearts to him, received him in, felt him there,
and found him made unto them their wisdom, their righteousness, their sanctification,
their redemption. 1 Cor. 1:30.
They had the thing that these words signify and speak of,
and knew the meaning of the words by an experience of the thing.
But Christians now, in the apostasy,
have a multitude of apprehensions taken from the words,
without experiencing the thing the words speak of; and therein lays their religion.

=== 8. The church, the true church, was lost.

The true church was a company gathered out of the world into God, begotten of,
and gathered into his life by the living Word,
and so they had a true place and habitation in God.
The Apostle Paul, writing to the Thessalonians, calls them the "`church in God.`"
The church under the gospel is made up of true Israelites,
gathered out of their own spirits and nature
into the measure of the Spirit of God in them.
They are begotten of God, born of his Spirit, led by him out of Egypt,
through the wilderness, to Zion the holy mount.
There they find the elect and precious cornerstone which is laid in Zion;
and being living stones, they are built upon it into Jerusalem the holy city.
1 Pet. 2:5-6. Heb. 12:22. This is the true church.

Everyone that believes in Christ is a living stone; and being a living stone,
he is laid upon the living foundation,
and so is a part of the building in the temple of the living God.
Yes, his body and spirit being cleansed, he himself is a temple wherein God dwells,
appears, and is worshiped.
And the gathering of any of these stones together at
any time in the life and name of Christ,
is a larger temple, and such a temple as Christ never fails to be in the midst of.

But what has the church been in the apostasy?
A building of stone, say some; and that not only among Catholics,
but among Protestants in England also.
Many have called a stone building the church, the temple, the house of God,
claiming it to be a holy place;
and have showed it by keeping off their hats while they were in it.
Others say it is not the stone building, but the people that meet there.
But these still scoff if they hear a man speak of being moved by the Spirit.

=== 9. The ministry, the true ministry, has been lost.

The true ministry was a ministry made and appointed by the Spirit,
by the gift that the Spirit bestowed on them,
and by the Spirit sending them and appointing them to their work.
Christ bid his apostles and disciples wait at Jerusalem for the promise of the Spirit.
And when he had given them the Spirit,
he gave these to the church for the work of the ministry.
Eph. 4:11-12. Acts 20:28. Now,
if none can be a member of the true church but by being
begotten out of death into life by the Spirit,
surely none is able to minister to him who is so begotten, except by the same Spirit.
So these receiving their ministry of the Lord Jesus, Acts 20:24.
and the gift of the Spirit from him, they were made
"`able ministers of the New Covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit.`" 2 Cor. 3:6.
They were able in God to minister from
his Spirit to the spirits of his people.
They did not minister a literal knowledge of things to the intellect of man;
but they led men to the Spirit of God,
and ministered spiritual things to that spiritual
understanding which was given them of God.
Neither did they make use of their own wisdom and art to tickle the natural ear;
but spoke to the conscience, with the demonstration of the Spirit in the sight of God,
as it pleased the Spirit to give them utterance.

But how have ministers been made in the apostasy?
By orders from men, set up in their own wills, after their own inventions.
And how have they been qualified, but by human arts and languages,
which have been of high esteem in the church since the
language and skill of the Spirit of God has been lost.
Here God does not choose who will be his ministers;
but any man can appoint his son to be a minister if he will only educate him in learning,
and send him to the university.
These then are able to minister unto man the things of man, according to human skill;
and this, in the dark night of apostasy,
has passed for a true call to the ministry of God.
Thus ministry also is but an invention of man, made by man,
and comes not from the Spirit, nor is able to minister spirit to spirit.

[.discourse-part]
Objection: But has there been no true religion since the days of the apostles?
No true rule, no true worship, no true faith, no true love, no true hope, joy, or peace?
No true repentance, conversion, and regeneration?
No true wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption?
No true church, no true ministry?
What is become of all our forefathers?
Did they all perish?
And has not this ministry converted many to God?
Were not you yourselves converted by it?
Indeed, have not many of them been martyrs, and witnessed to the truth of God?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The worship in the nations, the faith, love, hope, joy, peace, repentance,
conversion, regeneration, etc., which have been declared in nations for the truth,
the churches, the ministries, these have been corrupted,
and have never recovered their true and original state to this present day.
There have been changes from one thing to another;
but a true restoration has not been known.

Nevertheless, even throughout all the ages and generations,
God reserved a seed to himself, which he caused to spring up in a remnant,
and which he moved and carried on to witness against these corruptions.
And just as fast as the beast killed and knocked these down, God raised up more.

Now this seed, this remnant,
though they were not able to recover the full
possession of the life and power that was lost;
yet they had a true taste of it,
and their testimony which they gave out from that taste was true.
And so far as they kept to this testimony in the faith and patience which
they had learned and received from God (though but in a low measure),
they were accepted of him.
So that all were not lost in this night of darkness; but such as feared God,
and knew and hearkened to his voice, these had the testimony of his presence with them,
and tasted of his life and power in measure.
God was not a hard master to them; but tender and gentle,
and contented to reap what he sowed.
But the appearance of God in this dark time was weak and low, and easily made a prey of.
And this is very observable, that so long as the simplicity ran pure, it was preserved.
But just as soon as the spirit of man was tempted to establish outward forms (either old,
or newly invented) the wisdom of the flesh got in with it, grew up larger than it,
corrupted the vessel, betrayed the simplicity, and lost the life.
